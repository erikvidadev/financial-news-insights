The update submission follows Wednesday’s major Epic Games v. Apple ruling that forces Apple not to take a cut of payments on non-Apple payment systems and stops Apple from dictating how developers can tell users about outside payments.“While other governments around the world have taken steps against Apple’s harmful practices, this is, by far, the most consequential action to date – and it delivers the benefits that all consumers deserve around the world,” Spotify says.If Apple approves the update, Spotify says that US users:Can finally see how much something costs in our app, including pricing details on subscriptions and information about promotions that will save money; Can click a link to purchase the subscription of choice, upgrading from a Free account to one of our Premium plans;Can seamlessly click the link and easily change Premium subscriptions from Individual to a Student, Duo, or Family plan; Can use other payment options beyond just Apple’s payment system—we provide a wider range of options on our website; and Going forward, this opens the door to other seamless buying opportunities that will directly benefit creators (think easy-to-purchase audiobooks) “If all of this seems obvious and user-friendly, you’re right, and we agree – these are the kinds of improvements that any app should offer its users,” Spotify says. “The fact that we haven’t been able to deliver these basic services, which were permitted by the judge’s order four years ago, is absurd.”Now, we have to wait and see if Apple will approve the app update — which has been a bone of contention between Spotify and Apple in the past.Patreon announced earlier today that it plans to submit an update for its iOS app to Apple that will let creators accept payments outside of Apple’s payment system.",The Verge

It has taken a while—the app launched in 2012—but you can now use Apple Maps on the web. You can load it up in a browser on Windows PCs, Macs, iPads, and even in an Android phone's mobile browser.Right now, the Apple Maps web app has a beta label attached to it, which means it's a work in progress. Expect more features and better performance over time. (You can't yet sign in with your Apple ID, for example.) You also need a compatible browser, and that means Safari, Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.Despite its beta status, there's already a lot you can do with Apple Maps on the web, including looking up places, getting directions to specific places, and accessing guides to popular cities and other destinations.Map BasicsApple Maps on the web can give you a wealth of information about places.Courtesy of David NieldWe don't yet have the ability to sign into Apple Maps on the web, so you'll be starting fresh every time you open it in your browser, and you will not see links to your past searches or your saved places, for example. Click the arrow icon (in the top right) to jump to your current location, based on what location your browser is reporting.The map icon just above the arrow lets you choose the map view: Standard, Satellite, or a Hybrid combination of the two. There's also a compass icon just below. Click and drag on the compass to change the orientation of the map, or click once to go back to the default (where north is directly up). In the lower right corner you've got zoom controls, and you can also zoom in and out by pinching your touchscreen or trackpad or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.There's a navigation pane on the left you can show and hide using the icon in the very top left corner, and this gets you access to the key three parts of Apple Maps on the web: Search, Guides, and Directions. Search is simple enough: Just type in what you're looking for. You'll also see quick links to find restaurants, bars, gas stations, and other destinations in the map area you're currently looking at.With some of the larger and more well known cities in the world, an information panel pops up with more details about the place. This might include photos of landmarks as well as historical information pulled from Wikipedia. Major roads and sights worth seeing will be labeled on the map with these city overviews.",Wired

Apple juice, a perennial lunchroom staple, is a prime example. The vast majority of the apple juice Americans drink is imported from countries like China, and the Trump’s administration’s berserk tariff policies are now reshaping the market, potentially making beloved pome-based beverages more expensive or harder to find.“The price of juice is already increasing,” Christopher Gerlach, an executive at the US Apple Association, a trade group representing the domestic apple industry, tells WIRED. Gerlach estimates the wholesale cost of apple juice concentrate has risen 33 percent this year compared to 2024—and he expects it to keep going up. The higher costs will impact more than just plain apple juice, since concentrate is a key ingredient in a wide variety of other juice mixes, like mixed berry and pear, and is also used as a sweetener in a variety of children’s products, including baby food.The Trump administration’s protectionist policies have upended the global trading system as a whole. But the biggest impact so far has been on Chinese imports, which now face a new 145 percent tariff. The measure has driven up consumer prices and disrupted the supply chains for products ranging from baby gear to Christmas decorations to sex toys. While produce represents a relatively small portion of China’s exports to the US overall, there are certain types of food and drink heavily sourced from the country, like garlic, seafood, and, yes, apple juice. While apples are not typically associated with China, farmers there began investing more in the crop in the 1980s as they looked for ways to diversify their incomes, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).The US has plenty of domestic apple farms, but the industry focuses heavily on selling fresh fruits, which are typically more profitable. Each year, America exports around 16 million gallons of apple juice, but imports 430 million gallons, Gerlach says. For many years, China was the main place where the US sourced its apple juice, but Turkey has recently emerged as a close competitor. It represented 39 percent of US concentrated apple juice imports last year, while China accounted for 31 percent, according to Gerlach.Data from the USDA suggest that Trump’s tariffs have sparked a more dramatic shift in the US toward buying apple juice concentrate from Turkey. So far this year, Americans have imported around 92 million liters of unfrozen apple juice concentrate from China, compared to 29 million liters from Turkey. China saw a major spike in juice buying in January as importers raced to make purchases before the tariffs went into effect; now its sales have plummeted, while Turkey’s are soaring. For the week of April 25, Turkey exported more than twice as much apple juice concentrate to the US as did mainland China.",Wired

That’s just one of the memorable lines from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ stinging rebuke of Apple this week, in which she ruled that Apple needed to change the way it handled external payments, buttons, and links in apps. And it needed to do so now. Apple says it will appeal, but it has already changed the rules. The app economy might never be the same.On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about what just happened and why it matters. After some very important party speaker updates, Nilay, David, and The Verge’s Jake Kastrenakes walk through Apple’s years of closed-door meetings about app commissions, and the ways in which Gonzalez Rogers found she’d been misled throughout the process. (Nilay also takes a victory lap on the whole “buttons and links” thing.) We talk about how developers are responding to the news, as well as what new things you might be able to buy in the App Store, which new apps might suddenly be possible, and whether Apple has any moves left in this case.After that, it’s time for… more monopoly talk! Meta and Google are both still in court fighting to keep their companies intact. We’re learning a lot about how important TikTok has become, how Meta sees the world in general, and why it feared what might happen if Google bought WhatsApp. Meanwhile, just down the hall in the DC District courthouse, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made an impassioned case that this trial could be the end of Google Search.Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another (relatively brief) edition of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, followed by the latest from Worldcoin, Meta’s AI app, and more.

Apple has been forced to change its rules on external payments following an order in its ongoing case against Epic Games. The updated app, version 9.0.40, is rolling out now on the App Store.“In a victory for consumers, artists, creators, and authors, Apple has approved Spotify’s U.S. app update,” Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran told The Verge. “After nearly a decade, this will finally allow us to freely show clear pricing information and links to purchase, fostering transparency and choice for U.S. consumers. We can now give consumers lower prices, more control, and easier access to the Spotify experience.”Spotify submitted the update to Apple’s App Store yesterday, in what was seen as the first test of Apple’s new rules. The new version includes details on promotional pricing and subscription plans available directly from Spotify’s website, where its transactions won’t be subject to Apple’s 30 percent service charge on in-app payments. If you can’t see them yet, Moran told us that “it may take a beat” for the new options to appear on every phone, even if you have the latest version.Apple previously included strict restrictions on how developers were able to advertise and link to external payment options, forbidding the use of buttons or any mention of cheaper pricing outside the app, in addition to a 27 percent charge on external payments. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers put an end to that this week, ordering Apple to end all fees, design restrictions, and “scary” pop-up language for external payments.Spotify has long been one of the most vocal critics of Apple’s payment policies, and Moran had previously said that the “outrageous” external payment policy “flies in the face of the court’s efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.”Patreon has also announced that it intends to submit an update to enable external payments, while Epic is readying its own alternative payment processing system with lower fees than Apple’s.",The Verge

In a filing on Wednesday, Apple says the order contains “extraordinary intrusions” that could result in “grave irreparable harm” to the company.Last week, California District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction issued as part of the Epic Games v. Apple case. As a result, the judge ordered Apple to stop collecting an up to 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store, and said the company can no longer restrict how developers point users toward external purchases.Apple has since complied with the order, allowing apps like Kindle, Patreon, Spotify, and Delta’s emulator to link iPhone users to external purchases without an added fee or restrictions. However, Apple filed an appeal on Monday, and now it wants its control of the App Store back while it waits for a decision.“Depriving Apple of control over core features of the App Store is, standing alone, sufficient to warrant a stay,” Apple says in its motion to halt the order. “The new rules profoundly undercut the integrated iOS ecosystem that this Court sustained as lawful and that is the foundation of user trust and confidence in the App Store.”In a post on X, Epic Games said Apple’s motion to stay “is a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.”Update, May 8th: Added a statement from Epic Games.",The Verge

The company argues in the document that Apple is once again in contempt of the judge’s April order restricting it from rejecting apps over their use of outside payment links.In a letter from Apple that Epic shared late Friday, Apple writes that it won’t “take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction.” Epic claims the delay is retaliation for its legal fight with the company, and notes in its filing that Apple “expressly and repeatedly” told it and the court that it would approve Fortnite if the app complied with Apple’s guidelines, which it insists its current submission does.Following Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in April, Epic said Fortnite would return to the US App Store. The company has since submitted the game twice, most recently to include content from an update to the EU version of the game. But instead of Apple approving Fortnite in the US, the game disappeared from the EU App Store.Epic claimed that was because it can’t release in the EU because of Apple’s decision to block its US submission. Apple said it had merely asked that it resubmit the app without including the US storefront, “so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.” But in a post announcing its new filing, Epic claims that would mean it has to submit multiple versions of the app, which it says is against Apple’s guidelines.Epic is asking that the court enforce its injunction, find Apple in contempt again, and require the company to “accept any compliant Epic app, including Fortnite, for distribution on the U.S. storefront of the App Store.”The hitch here is that throughout this case, Judge Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t gone so far as to require Fortnite’s return to the store, finding in her 2021 ruling that Epic had still knowingly broken its developer agreement with apple. 9to5Mac writes that the judge would likely need to agree that Apple is once again in contempt of court, as she did in her April 30th ruling. The difference between now and then — and what could work in Epic’s favor — is just how annoyed she seemed with Apple in the text of that ruling.Apple did not immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.",The Verge

After all, I’d describe the iPhone 15 Pro sitting on my desk right now as “mostly glass,” with the only exterior metal being around the camera lenses and in its titanium edge, which the front and back curve down to. Assuming he’s not describing a banana-shaped iPhone, the closest hints are probably in Apple patents revealed over the years, like one from 2019 that describes a phone encased in glass that “forms a continuous loop” around the device.Apart from a changing iPhone, Gurman describes what sounds like a big year for Apple. He reiterates past reports that the first foldable iPhone should be out by 2027, and that the company’s first smart glasses competitor to Meta Ray-Bans will be along that year. So will those rumored camera-equipped AirPods and Apple Watches, he says.Gurman also suggests that Apple’s home robot — a tabletop robot that features “an AI assistant with its own personality” — will come in 2027. On that “personality” mention, it’s hard not to think about the adorable robotic lamp Apple’s internal researchers have been tinkering with.Finally, Gurman writes that by 2027 Apple could finally ship an LLM-powered Siri and may have created new chips for its server-side AI processing. A December report from The Information covered such a development and suggested that the team handling Apple’s new AI chips is the same Israel-based silicon design group that was “instrumental in designing” the Apple silicon chips that let the company ditch Intel chips for its Macs in 2020.",The Verge

And much of its effort hinges on rebuilding Siri from the ground up.Gurman has reported in the past that Apple is working on what it’s internally calling “LLM Siri” — a reworked, generative AI version of the company’s digital assistant. Apple’s previous approach of merging the assistant with the existing Siri hasn’t been working. Gurman describes in great detail a number of reasons why, but here’s a quick summary:Now the company is trying to rejigger its approach. Part of that is a total overhaul of Siri, rather than just trying to make generative AI work in concert with the old Siri. According to Gurman, Apple has its AI team in Zurich working on a new architecture that will “entirely build on an LLM-based engine.” Gurman reported in November last year that the company was working on this, and the idea is that it will make the assistant “more believably conversational and better at synthesizing information.”Another part of the solution is leveraging iPhones and differential privacy to improve Apple’s synthesized data — comparing fake training data with language from iPhone users’ emails, but doing so on-device and sending only the synthesized data back to Apple for AI training. And one way the company is discussing improving Siri is letting the LLM version loose on the web to “grab and synthesize data from multiple sources.” Basically, Siri as an AI web search tool not unlike Perplexity, which is one of the companies Apple has approached about partnering for AI search in Safari.Whatever the outcome, apparently Giannandrea won’t be a direct part of it, having been taken off of product development, Siri, and robotics projects in the spring. According to Gurman, Apple execs have talked about putting him “on a path to retirement,” but are concerned that some of the research and engineering folks he brought with him would leave with him, too.

The appeal will challenge last week’s ruling that prevents the company from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.In 2021, the Epic v. Apple lawsuit resulted in a court order enjoining Apple from anti-steering activities — that is, hindering developers from telling users to make purchases outside of the app. The case was revived last year when Epic Games alleged that Apple had violated that court order. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers not only agreed with Epic Games but also found that Apple’s Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, had lied under oath and referred the matter to the district’s federal prosecutor for potential criminal investigation. The judge additionally sanctioned Apple for “misuse of attorney-client privilege designations to delay proceedings.”",The Verge

However, if you want features like Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro support without spending a fortune on an iPad Pro, the latest iPad Mini might be the better option. That’s especially true now given Apple’s smallest tablet is matching its all-time low at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, where you can grab the base configuration with Wi-Fi starting at around $399 ($100 off).As Apple’s smallest iPad, the 8.3-inch Mini is more portable than its larger siblings, making it a great travel companion. It’s easy to hold with one hand and offers all-day battery life, rendering it an even better value if you read a lot. It also delivers good performance courtesy of its A17 Pro chip, so you can stream Netflix, shoot emails, play games, and even make video calls with ease (even if the camera is still awkwardly placed while using the tablet in landscape mode). As mentioned previously, the seventh-gen Mini also provides access to Apple’s growing suite of AI-powered features, which don’t quite live up to the hype but are starting to become more useful with time. This includes ChatGPT integration and priority notifications, along with tools for proofreading, summarizing messages, enhancing photos, and even creating your own custom emojis and images. What’s more, if you own an Apple Pencil Pro, you can play around with a host of creative features that aren’t available on the entry-level Apple Pencil with USB-C, like double-tap tool switching. You can also leverage FindMy support, should you ever misplace your stylus, and solve math problems by writing them out. That’s in addition to a host of other iPadOS 18 features, the bulk of which don’t require a stylus.",The Verge

It only takes a few taps or clicks, and you’ll have the highest level of security protection that Apple offers.How Lockdown Mode protects youLockdown Mode is available on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Screenshot: AppleIt’s worth bearing in mind that there are some tradeoffs when using Lockdown Mode. The software you use will be limited in some of its functionality to give would-be hackers fewer ways to get at you and your data.You’ll find most attachments in Messages blocked, while FaceTime calls are only permitted with people you’ve had contact with in the last month. In Photos, you can’t create or even see shared albums, and Focus modes are disabled, too. New device connections are only allowed if your iPhone, iPad, or Mac is unlocked when the connection is made.Certain parts of Safari get disabled, too, with many web technologies (that may be used to launch an attack) turned off. You’ll see missing images and fonts that don’t look right, and certain websites might load slowly or not work at all.You won’t be able to install new configuration profiles (for testing apps, for example), and there’s no support for unsecured Wi-Fi networks. You’ll also lose the ability to access Game Center — sorry, gamers.Lockdown Mode is enabled on a device-by-device basis, so enabling it on your Mac won’t automatically enable it on your iPhone. You will get a prompt across all the devices associated with your Apple account once you’ve turned the mode on for one device. How to enable Lockdown ModeLeft: Lockdown Mode is under Privacy & Security in Settings. Right: You get plenty of info about Lockdown Mode before enabling it. Screenshot: AppleConsidering how dramatic Lockdown Mode is in terms of the changes it makes to your devices, it’s surprisingly easy to enable. Open Settings in iOS or iPadOS.Choose Privacy & Security.Scroll down to and tap Lockdown Mode.Select Turn On Lockdown Mode. You’ll get a summary of how it will affect your phone use. Tap Turn On Lockdown Mode again to confirm.Select Turn On & Restart.You’ll need to enter your phone or tablet passcode, and then your device will reboot. When you get back into the software, Lockdown Mode will be enabled. Open the Apple menu, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode.Select Turn On.On the next dialog, click Turn On Lockdown Mode. As with iOS, you’ll get a summary of how it will affect your phone use. Click Turn On Lockdown Mode again to confirm.Finally, choose Turn On & Restart.You’ll need to enter the password associated with your Mac account, and then the computer will reboot, enabling Lockdown Mode along the way.Once you enable Lockdown Mode, you’ll need to restart your device. Screenshot: AppleCustomize and disable Lockdown ModeThere aren’t many ways to customize Lockdown Mode, but you can exclude certain websites from its restrictions in Safari, if you want to. When you’re on a page in Safari on an iPhone or iPad, tap the menu button (to the left of the web URL), then the three dots, then disable Lockdown Mode. On macOS, choose Safari > Settings for <website>, and uncheck Enable Lockdown Mode.Whatever device you’re using, you’ll see a confirmation dialog appear. Tap Turn Off to confirm. You can exclude certain websites from Lockdown Mode restrictions. Screenshot: AppleYou can review and edit your website exclusion list, too. From Settings on iOS and iPadOS, choose Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode > Configure Web Browsing. On macOS, open Safari then pick Safari > Settings > Websites > Lockdown Mode.If you’re starting to feel safer (or just inconvenienced by the restrictions), getting out of Lockdown Mode is just as easy as enabling it: simply retrace your original steps to find the option. Again, you’ll need to have your passcode or password to hand and restart your device, and then you’ll be back to normal.",The Verge

Apple judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers just ruled that, effective immediately, Apple is no longer allowed to collect fees on purchases made outside apps and blocks the company from restricting how developers can point users to where they can make purchases outside of apps. Apple says it will appeal the order.The ruling was issued as part of Epic Games’ ongoing legal dispute against Apple, and it’s a major victory for Epic’s arguments. Gonzalez Rogers also says that Apple “willfully” chose not to comply with her previous injunction from her original 2021 ruling. “That [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,” Gonzalez Rogers says.The judge also referred the case to the US attorney to review it for possible criminal contempt proceedings.As part of the ruling, the judge says that Apple cannot:Apple’s senior director of corporate communications, Olivia Dalton, sent a statement to The Verge that reads, “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.”Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says that, following this ruling, the company will bring Fortnite back to the US App Store “next week.” Sweeney is also offering a “peace proposal” from Epic: “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.”In many cases, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of purchases made in its apps, and Gonzalez Rogers’ 2021 ruling forced Apple to allow developers to point to alternative payment options. But Apple instituted a policy that demanded developers pay Apple a 27 percent commission on those purchases, which many companies, including Epic, were unhappy about.“In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction,” Gonzalez Rogers says. She notes that, inside Apple, App Store chief Phil Schiller advocated for the company to comply with the injunction, but that CEO Tim Cook “chose poorly” by ignoring Schiller and letting CFO Luca Maestri “convince him otherwise.”Update, April 30th: Added statement from Apple.",The Verge

During the search monopoly trial on Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed the company expects to strike a Gemini deal with Apple by the middle of this year and suggested it would roll out by the end of 2025.The integration would presumably allow Siri to call on Gemini to answer more complex questions, similar to the integration that Apple launched with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi hinted at plans to build Gemini into its Apple Intelligence feature last June, when the AI service was first announced. “We want to enable users ultimately to choose the models they want, maybe Google Gemini in the future,” Federighi said at the time.Today’s update came in response to questions asked by Department of Justice lawyer Veronica Onyema. Pichai answered “Correct” when asked about these plans. He also said he had met with Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss AI development. “He [Cook] was trying to understand our plans for how we’re evolving AI technologies, our roadmap, and as part of that, we talked about the Gemini app distribution as well,” Pichai said. He added that he was told by Cook that more third-party AI models would ship on Apple Intelligence later this year.There are other signs that this integration is on the way. In February, MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris found references to “Google” as an Apple Intelligence model choice in an iOS 18.4 beta. With Apple’s ChatGPT integration, Siri automatically asks for permission to use the third-party AI model to answer more complex questions. ChatGPT can also analyze photos and generate images based on text.",The Verge

As a first step, we will submit an app update for review by Apple to enable payments outside of IAP so creators keep more from iOS based fan payments.”Last year, Patreon said it was forced to switch to Apple’s in-app purchase system, which applied a 30 percent fee to all new memberships purchased in the app, or else risk “being removed from the App Store.”“When we first announced rolling out Apple’s IAP requirements last year, we shared that we used three principles to guide our decision in how we wanted to move forward: transparency, control, and stability,” Taylor says. “Keeping with those principles, we’re exploring further action we can take, and we’ll continue to keep creators and fans posted on any changes to our experience.”Taylor wasn’t able to share a timeline for when the update might be rolled out.Spotify told The Verge last night the company is also planning an update in response to the ruling. “Spotify will move quickly to submit an app update to Apple, enhancing the experience for our consumers across the United States,” spokesperson Jeanne Moran said.

The return was made possible by the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which required Apple to allow third-party app stores on iOS.Epic had resubmitted Fortnite to the US App Store this month following a recent ruling in Epic’s lawsuit against Apple. That ruling prohibited Apple from restricting developers’ ability to link to external payment systems, one of the issues that had started their long-running legal battle. Epic was forced to use its Swedish developer account to resubmit the game, as its US account was terminated in 2020 when it first broke Apple’s rules by introducing its own in-app payments to the game.This week Epic CEO Tim Sweeney announced that the company had pulled its previous Fortnite submission and submitted a new version that included an update due to release today, noting that “all platforms must update simultaneously.” He’s since taken to X repeatedly to complain that unofficial Fortnite knock-offs have been allowed into the App Store while Fortnite hasn’t, claiming that Apple’s app review process has been “weaponized by senior management.”Update, May 16th: Added comment from Apple.",The Verge

Just Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Foxconn, Apple’s main manufacturer, is developing a $1.5 billion plant in southern India’s Chennai to supply iPhone displays. Apple has been diversifying its production for several years, which was accelerated by both covid and US animosity towards China.Speaking to reporters, Trump said of Cook, “He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, that’s okay to go to India, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs, and that’s the way it is.”India is currently subject to the “baseline” 10 percent tariff that applies worldwide, while China is at a higher 30 percent rate, though that could rise substantially in August once a 90-day reduction in rates lifts. Phones, and most of Apple’s other products, are exempt from the majority of those rates anyway, but the ongoing uncertainty gives Apple good reason to continue expanding production outside China.While Apple has pledged to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years (and CEO Cook personally invested $1 million in Trump’s inauguration fund), it’s widely acknowledged by industry experts that a “Made in America” iPhone isn’t realistic. As Steve Jobs reportedly told Barack Obama in 2011: “Those jobs aren’t coming back.”Update, May 23rd: Added details from Trump’s White House comments.",The Verge

At least on this occasion, Apple’s revenue numbers weren’t top of mind for tech industry onlookers like they ordinarily would be. Still, overall revenue in fiscal Q2 2025 was $95.4 billion — a 5 percent jump compared to the year-ago quater — and services reached another all-time high. The iPhone, Mac, and iPad businesses all performed well thanks to new products; the iPad was particularly strong, with revenue up 15 percent year over year.In recent months, Apple has released hardware including new MacBook Airs, a more powerful Mac Studio, and the refreshed iPad Air tablet. And the iPhone 16E, designed to compete with lower-cost smartphones, debuted in February. But Apple’s software team has been going through a rough patch following a series of stumbles and embarrassments.The company’s attempts to build out its own artificial intelligence capabilities that rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other leaders in the category have been slow going. In early March, long-promised improvements to the company’s Siri assistant were delayed. Apple is rumored to be integrating Google’s Gemini to its Apple Intelligence software suite this fall to help keep pace.Meanwhile, the effect of President Trump’s tariffs are already reverberating across many industries, but Cook downplayed any major impacts in an interview with CNBC. He pointed to Apple’s well-distributed supply chain and manufacturing operation as a potential buffer. “If you look at the US, over half of the US sales of iPhone come from India,” he said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” Much has been made about the possibility of Apple’s next iPhone lineup getting a price hike. “With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said. Apple is also navigating significant legal battles. In a Wednesday ruling, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers excoriated Apple executives including CEO Tim Cook for deliberately trying to limit and mollify a 2021 ruling intended to loosen the iPhone maker’s grip over the App Store. Apple has appealed Rogers’ order, but if it holds, companies including Epic, Spotify, and Patreon are planning to seize the opportunity to more freely sidestep Apple’s in-app payments and steer users to the web.",The Verge

Jud… [+2982 chars]","Apple “willfully chose not to comply” with a court order to loosen its app store restrictions—and one of its executives lied under oath about the company’s plans, a federal judge wrote on Wednesday.Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has referred the situation to the US Attorney’s Office in San Francisco “to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.”In 2021, Gonzalez Rogers presided over a lawsuit brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games over the iPhone maker’s allegedly anticompetitive practices that hampered the ability of developers to generate revenue from the App Store. This included Apple’s policy of taking a 30 percent commission on certain in-app purchases.While Gonzalez Rogers ultimately ruled in favor of Apple on most counts, she ordered the company to begin allowing developers to market ways to make in-app purchases outside of the App Store ecosystem. Apple responded by lowering its commission to 27 percent on purchases made elsewhere, but it also introduced a series of other changes, including showing so-called scare screens, to dissuade users from making purchases outside its ecosystem.Last year, Epic challenged in court how Apple was responding to the order, leading Gonzalez Rogers to require the tech giant to turn over documents that contributed to Wednesday's contempt ruling.Apple pursued its noncompliance strategy “with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her ruling on Wednesday. “That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.”She also said that Apple executives tried to hide the real motivations for the changes. “In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,” Gonzalez Rogers said. She went as far as accusing Alex Roman, a vice president of finance at Apple, of lying during testimony in which he talked about how Apple came to its decision to go with a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside the App Store. “The testimony of Mr. Roman was replete with misdirection and outright lies,” the judge said.“We strongly disagree with the decision,” Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton said in a statement to WIRED. ""We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal."" Roman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Citing internal Apple documents from 2023, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple’s App Store chief Phillip Schiller “had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction” but that CEO Tim Cook “ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.”The judge demanded that Apple immediately comply with her earlier order. “This is an injunction, not a negotiation,” she wrote. “There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition.”Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X that the new ruling would bring an end to “Apple’s 15-30% junk fees.”Update 4/30/25 10:00 ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.",Wired

The brain-computer interface, or BCI, industry is projected to grow significantly over the coming decades. Perhaps the best-known player in the space is Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which, as of January, has successfully implanted its devices in three people. Historically, most users have relied on both mechanical (through the use of a keyboard or mouse) and behavioral (through the use of touchscreens or voice) interaction with their computers. BCIs eliminate the need for physical movement, expanding device accessibility for people with profound physical impairments. 

 Unlike Neuralink’s N1 implant, Synchron’s stent-like device, called the Stentrode, is implanted on top of the brain, not inside of it, which allows users to avoid an invasive open brain implant procedure. Once placed, the Stentrode works by using its electrodes to read brain signals and translate them into on-screen navigation and icon selection.  Synchron’s device works with switch control, a pre-existing accessibility feature in Apple’s operating system that allows users to remotely control their Mac with an external adaptive device like a joystick or switch (or now, the Stentrode). Since 2019, Synchron has implanted the Stentrode in 10 people.  The Journal visited Mark Jackson, a Pittsburgh resident who cannot travel outside his home due to ALS. Jackson tested the Stentrode with an Apple Vision Pro. With the headset on, he was transported to Switzerland, where he peered over the ledge of an alpine peak and felt his legs shake. 

 Jackson noted that because he can’t use the Stentrode to mimic moving a cursor with a mouse or a touchscreen with his fingers, navigation using the Stentrode is much slower than typical interaction with a computer or smartphone. It’s also slower than using a computer with Neuralink’s N1, which is able to capture much more brain data than Synchron’s device, which uses many more electrodes than the Stentrode. These latest developments in BCI technology come in anticipation of full FDA approval for the implants, which, the Journal notes, is not expected for several more years. 

 In a press release, Dr. Tom Oxley, the CEO and co-founder of Synchron, praised Apple, saying that the company is “helping to pioneer a new interface paradigm, where brain signals are formally recognized alongside touch, voice, and typing. With BCI recognized as a native input for Apple devices, there are new possibilities for people living with paralysis and beyond.”",Gizmodo.com

Did Apple get too big for … [+6075 chars]","We’re doing something a little different on today’s episode of Decoder. I asked my friend John Gruber, of the website Daring Fireball, to come on the show and talk about the future of Apple — and, importantly, the App Store.Gruber and I have been friends for over a decade now. Daring Fireball was one of the first and most influential Apple blogs around, and he has more insight into Apple, its culture, and how it does things than anyone else. Everyone at Apple and in the Apple developer community reads Daring Fireball religiously.In 2010, Steve Jobs himself emailed Gruber’s analysis of an early App Store rule change to an unhappy developer and called it “very insightful.” Personally, I will always remember a moment early in my career when a very excited Apple PR staffer pointed Gruber out to me at an event like a celebrity sighting, which was funny and also deeply humbling.I wanted to have him on the show to talk about the most recent ruling in the Epic v. Apple legal saga. This is the lawsuit about Fortnite on the iPhone and whether developers like Epic can circumvent the App Store’s payment system to avoid paying those 30 percent fees on in-app purchases.Well, late last month, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who has presided over that case for the past five years, effectively banned Apple from collecting fees on web transactions. She also harshly accused of the company of purposefully disobeying her original 2021 ruling by creating a series of restrictions and hoops to jump through that would basically make it impossible for developers to send people to the web to buy things. The judge’s extreme frustration with Apple is obvious in almost every line of her ruling; she even referred an Apple executive for criminal proceedings, saying this executive had lied under oath on the stand.Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!There’s a lot of tactical stuff you might talk about in the aftermath of this ruling — about what Apple might do next, how it might impact revenue, and how developers might respond. But I really wanted Gruber to talk about Apple’s big picture and how a company that so often prides itself on doing the right thing ended up so fully on the wrong side of the courts.One theme you’ll hear throughout this conversation is that Apple often presents itself as small, but the company is actually huge in every way — Apple now sells nearly as many phones in a single quarter as it did in the entire first three years of the iPhone’s existence combined. It now operates in a geopolitical context that binds the United States, China, and Taiwan in ways you would have never imagined 15 years ago. And perhaps most importantly, Apple has control over applications on the iPhone, which means it has control over what kinds of businesses can and cannot exist on its mobile phones.That’s the context for the other major theme here that you’ll pick up on in this conversation: Apple’s major shift toward digital services and whether that’s fundamentally changed the company’s culture. You see, as Apple kept selling newer and better iPhones, it simply ran out of people to sell them to. So, in order to keep growing revenue and keep Wall Street happy, it started squeezing more money from its existing customer base, including the very developers that put apps on the App Store. That made some of the most important developers, the companies that make mobile games and stream media, very upset. But they had no other choice so they kept their apps in the App Store and continued to pay the fees — except for some major exceptions like Amazon and Spotify, which simply refused to sell you ebooks or music subscriptions on iOS at all. (After this most recent ruling, Amazon updated its Kindle app to sell ebooks via the web, while Spotify is working to update its iOS app to do the same for its subscriptions.)All of that combined with Apple’s scale created a kind of hubris and, as you’ll hear Gruber say, a major blind spot for Apple that has pushed it toward these high-profile and public legal defeats that could reshape its business. If all of that weren’t enough to put the heat on Apple, there’s also Trump’s tariffs to deal with and a Google antitrust trial that could see Google barred from striking an exclusivity deal for its search engine that currently pays Apple north of $20 billion a year.Apple also has to compete in AI with Apple Intelligence and Siri, products that are currently a total mess. Gruber and I got into all that at the end here, and I wanted to know if there was a connection between the corporate culture that produced the App Store debacle and the recent news of Siri delays and dysfunction around AI inside Apple.There’s a whole lot going on in this conversation, and there’s really nobody better to talk about all of this than Gruber. I hope you like this one; as you’ll soon hear, Gruber and I really enjoy talking to each other.Okay, John Gruber of Daring Fireball on the future of Apple and the App Store. Here we go.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. John Gruber, the proprietor of Daring Fireball, the industry’s leading Apple analysis source. How are you doing?I’m good. There’s been a lot of Apple news recently. I feel like we’re in this state where two years from now, or maybe three years from now, none of the big tech companies that we are familiar with look the same, or are the same. Google might get broken up, Meta is in the middle of an antitrust trial, Apple’s facing one, but then they’d already faced one. There was a big ruling in that case. I want to talk about that Epic case, and the Google money might go away from Apple, too.I wanted to talk to you, because you and I were texting briefly and I just thought I should just have John on the show and we should talk about what Apple is right now, what it has become, and what might be changing. Because you’ve been following the company closer than anybody for 20-odd years. It feels like the question of “what is Apple right now” is more up for grabs than it has been in a long time.Two things I keep coming back to, and it was such an off-the-cuff, “Yeah, sure. Why don’t I spend an hour?” For me, it turned into three hours, but why don’t I spend an afternoon on this seemingly goofy blog post of, “Hey, how many iPhones can you fit on an airplane?” When there was a report, when these tariffs came out, of, “Hey, Apple’s going to ship six full airplanes of iPhones from India ahead of the tariffs.” It is a fun little question. My friend Ryan Jones, the guy behind Flighty, had the idea of, “Hey, you could just look at the weight of a Boeing 747 freight airplane and figure out how much does a packaged iPhone weigh and multiply it, and there’s your answer.”Maybe it’s slightly off because maybe the volume doesn’t quite fit, maybe, but as a baseline, the weight works, and it’s like a lot of iPhones in a certain sense. If me and you had to spend the afternoon doing the manual labor of loading pallets of that many iPhones onto a Boeing 747, we would agree that’s a lot of iPhones. But then you look at how many iPhones Apple sells in the United States in a typical April, and it was like 12 days [inaudible 00:06:40]. It gave me this palpable sense of just how big a business the iPhone is.I don’t see how any company could not become distorted by that level of success. These are $1,000 bricks. A brand-new iPhone comes in a little brick of a package, and they’re $750, $800, $900, $1,000, $1,200, whatever, depending which one you get. They just send all of them, all the time nonstop out of China and India for $1,000 each with famously 35 percent, 40 percent margins. It is hard to fathom, and I feel like we’re hitting the point where we’re seeing the ramifications of the unfathomability of the iPhone’s success. I needed an excuse to buy a new Mac Studio when they got announced, the M4s, and the tariffs were a good excuse. I think a lot of people just took the excuse, “I might as well buy one.” I did a little custom configuring, made sure it had the right amount of storage and RAM, and all this stuff. Then I watched it get manufactured to my specifications in China, go through customs in China, get on DHL, come across the ocean on a plane presumably, and then get to my house in a matter of days. We don’t think about that very often, but that is Apple’s success, that that whole system exists. One thing I’ve been saying a lot recently is Tim Cook probably has more responsibility for world peace over the past several decades than anyone wants to give him.Because it’s his company that binds the United States and China, and to a large extent, Taiwan together now from the chips, from the manufacturing to the global trade to the fact that the platform, unlike most other tech companies, operates in both countries and is a huge success in both countries and consumers want the products in both countries. He has had to play statesman with Donald Trump, with Xi Jinping, with Joe Biden to whatever extent this whole time. It feels like Apple is more of that company than the big swing product company lately.Well, and the other thing that came out of my thinking about the scale of the iPhone success, and this being Tim Cook’s company, is just how unlikely it was. I truly do believe there was only one path for the iPhone to meet demand at the prices they’ve been selling iPhones for the last 15, 18 years, however long it’s been. But when the iPhone became this sensation, right, and famously, it’s such an interesting way to think of it, but they sold more... The second gen was the 3G. They sold more than the original, and then the 3GS sold more than the 3G and the original combined. Then the iPhone 4 sold more in one year than the 3GS, 3G, and original combined.That kept going for a couple of years, where each new model not only outsold the previous model, it outsold all the previous models combined. Now obviously, that had to end eventually, and it ended, I don’t know, 2013, 2014. Because the planet ran out of people.The mechanism of that, just to be very clear for the audience, is every year Apple would add new countries and new carriers. You would have all the people on AT&T in the United States, and then you would add Verizon, and then you would triple the market.But if you really think about it at an operational level, the only way that they could make that many iPhones and that many more new ones each year was through China. There was no other mechanism, no other way, no other country had anything vaguely like the capability to expand a supply chain that quickly to these incredibly tight, high-precision specifications than China. That’s the only way. In some ways, if you just go back a little bit, even like a decade before the iPhone, just go back to the ‘90s, it seems very iffy for China to be the path for an American company to be able to build this business from, the most profitable business in the history of capitalism.Steve Jobs famously wanted to build his own automated factories in California, and he did for some of the Macs. Then he hires Tim Cook, and Cook is the one who moves all the manufacturing to third-party contractors like Foxconn, moves it all to China, and begins to scale.Even going back to NeXT... I mean, again, NeXT for the decade or so that they were an independent company, they were only selling hardware for about the first half of it. But at that point, they had a Steve Jobs–driven dream, not just to make the computers in America, but to have computers build the computers. So there’s a lot of people out there, I think casual people who don’t need to know this, who probably think like, “Oh, an iPhone. That’s probably mostly made by robots.” It’s not. The factory line, it really is human beings screwing tiny screws into phones, putting tiny... Just keep putting this one component into a phone, here comes another phone, put that tiny component in perfectly. It is very labor-intensive.The next dream was to build a factory in California where it really was just like something from the Jetsons where it’s all robots and robotic arms, and a human being just delivers the box to you. But it obviously didn’t work out.I’m going to come to the manufacturing part of it. I do feel like our own Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is very confused about what it takes to build an iPhone, but we’ll come back to that. I just want to stay focused on this big Tim Cook change for one second. Tim Cook helps Apple expand, right? Without a doubt, something like the iPhone cannot scale to the volumes of production at Apple’s quality level in particular, without Tim Cook, master of the supply chain. That’s the role he plays for Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs has these very big ideas. He is incredibly tasteful, incredibly exacting in his demands.Tim Cook is the person who says, “Okay, I can build you the machine that will make hundreds of millions of these products a year to your specifications.” Tim Cook becomes CEO, and you see, over time, the company gets even bigger, right? It’s much bigger now than it ever was as a company owner Steve Jobs, the scale of that operation has increased, but I also think the Cook era will be remembered for this as much as the scale. They ran out of people, as you said.They moved the iPhone’s revenue from selling more iPhones every quarter to extracting more money from the people using their iPhones, in particular, in services, right? That’s the line they call it in their quarterly earning services. Services, it has a lot of celebrities as the face. It has Severance, it has Silo, it has all these other shows, Ted Lasso, famously.All of music. But what it really is, and this comes to the big court decision, what it really is is in-app purchases. Particularly, in-app purchases in games. Apple services revenue is people buying stuff on their iPhone, and Apple takes whatever percentage between 15 percent and 30 percent, depending on the style of app and the subscription or not. That’s the thing that’s under threat now, right?Well, but I know you know this. The other thing, and it is a lot of money, and it all goes into services, is the traffic acquisition costs from Google search with the deal with Safari, which is, probably, we keep talking about $20 billion a year, but I’ll bet it’s closer to $25 billion a year right now.Apple has a deal where Google pays to be the default search provider in Safari. Google lost that trial. We’re in the remedies phase. Google does not want to give up the ability to make these exclusive deals. It feels like that’s going to be the first thing to go, no matter what the judge decides. That’s $20 billion, $25 billion off from Apple. Then there’s this ruling in Epic versus Apple where the judge is furious with Apple for ignoring her earlier instructions, for lying on the stand. She says, one of the executives lies on the stand, and she says, in a variety of ways that I want you to explain, “Now you have to go compete with purchases on the web. We’re done. We’re done playing games.”That feels like, “Oh, the services’ revenue is going to drop.” No matter what happens now, the amount of money you’re going to take from in-app purchases and games and other apps is going to go down. Because Amazon is just going to kick people to the web. It’s already happening. Spotify is going to kick people to the web, it’s already happening.They’re not losing money from Amazon or Spotify though because they weren’t making money from Amazon. It’s the games. Where the games are really going to do it is by prompting the whales to, “Hey, you, a guy or a woman who spends $500 a month on tokens or chips or coins or whatever you call it for this game, we will give you a 40 percent discount if you just tap this button and preload your account from the web.” If you’re spending $200, $300, $400 a month on a game, which 1 percent of players do for some of these games. This is where an enormous amount of the money for the most profitable games comes from. It’s exactly like a casino. It really is.But I want to be clear that the services’ revenue line for Apple, the face of it is Severance. The face of it is Jennifer Aniston in The Morning Show. The reality of it is Candy Crush whales. That has been true for a long time. You’re just looking at a company where its manufacturing excellence is under threat with tariffs and trade wars, for all of Cook’s efforts to hold it together.Now, the revenue pressure on what the iPhone has become in services is extremely real from regulators not in Europe, which are also mad at Apple, but from the courts in the United States, which are saying, “Well, maybe we’re going to take the Google deal off the table, and maybe we’re going to take all this Candy Crush money off the table.” Is Apple ready for all of that?There’s a part of me that, for years now, has been looking at some of these things, and I’ve been thinking, I don’t know, maybe they know something I don’t know. Because they don’t seem panicked. I would say with their compliance with Gonzalez Rogers’ original injunction with the Epic case in 2021, which was a case... I think you’ll agree with me. The Epic versus Apple case, Apple almost entirely won. Epic lost, Apple won.But on what I would call a side note, she issued this injunction coming out of it that, “Oh, you win almost all these points, Epic, you lose almost all these points.” But this whole nonsense about the anti-steering provisions and apps being forbidden from even telling people famously, most famously, like with Netflix. If you’re a new Netflix user on iOS, you get the app, there’s no way to sign up. It said something like, “We know this isn’t convenient. We’re sorry about that.”I did a story years ago where they have a number you can call. You can actually call a phone number and make a real phone call and talk to a human being at Netflix, and I pretended I didn’t know how to sign up. They’re like, “Oh, you have to go to our website, go to a computer, and go to netflix.com, and then you’ll sign up there, and enter your credit card information there, and you can’t do it in the app.” They’re allowed to put a phone number that you can call where a human will tell you that, but they can’t just tell you that on the screen.I mean, imagine how much money they’re just wasting by having people answer the phone to do that. At this point, I doubt there are that many people calling every day, but somebody is, and it costs real money, and they could just put it on a screen. It’s just information: “You can’t do that anymore.” And they just kept doing it and instituted this “compliance” with it that was almost... And I’m very resistant to the whole malicious compliance argument, especially with their EU stuff. I think that term gets overused. But in the case of this injunction, it was almost... And the way that her new injunction or new decision that came out a week or two ago is just dripping with anger because it was so clear. But for the last four years I’ve been thinking, “Does Apple know something about her opinion on this that I don’t know?” And you’re the lawyer, you tell me.But my understanding, and you know I’m married to a lawyer and my wife has said to me, “No, if it’s not in the injunction, it’s not there. There are no backroom deals and handshakes between lawyers and judges. The decision comes out and it’s in writing, and you can just read it and it’s there.” And there was nothing in that injunction that made it seem like Apple’s goofy 27 percent commissions and, “You have to open up your books and let us audit all of your transactions and track people for seven days and everything they buy. After leaving your apps for seven days, you owe us 27 percent for it.” There was nothing that made it seem like that complied with the injunction, it was very strange. I don’t see how they thought it was compliant or how they thought it would fly.I’ve been thinking a lot broadly about the image the big companies want you to have of them and then what they have to be in order to be as big as they are and [as] successful as they are. Google, I think, still wants you to think of them as beanies and slides in the office. They’re a ruthless advertising company. We have all these emails from all of these trials. You can see the internal deliberations of these companies. I think Apple, to its credit, still wants you to believe that it is the company that puts the customer first and user experience first and design first, and then you see from the emails in this case that they had no reason for 27 percent except they knew that no one would use it.And there’s this gap, and I think a lot of the danger for these companies is that these regulatory efforts expose that gap. And I think there’s reasons for the gap. To be a company of this scale moving this much money around, you got to have some sharks, that’s just the way it goes. You just don’t want the sharks to be exposed to the public in this way. If you go too far, the judge is like, “You know what? I’m going to have a second hearing because I think you’ve been lying to me. You’re going to produce all of the evidence so I can see your decision-making and here are the sharks.” And there’s just something about that with Apple in particular that I think is just fundamentally surprising to people and damaging to its brand in a way that I think if I said to you, “Amazon is full of sharks,” or, “Meta is full of sharks,” you’d be like, “Yep.”Yeah, and there’s something in there with the Upton Sinclair line. It’s slightly not quite applicable, but it’s the same sentiment that it’s very difficult to make a man understand something that his job depends upon him not understanding it, right?And there is something to that with Apple on this front where everybody I know and have any relationship with at Apple, but especially higher up, the sort of people that we get press briefings with, people with big titles, not necessarily the very highest, but people who get featured in keynotes, people who are on the videos, they really do believe, they really do. They’re not feigning it. They really do believe that Apple is a good company and that they do the right thing and that they really do put the user first, and that they are a fundamentally honest company.And because they believe that, I feel like their actions on this particular issue with the app store, they can’t see it. It really is a blind spot where they just cannot believe that they keep losing these cases, they really can’t. That’s what I think. But all the rest of us, everybody else, whether you are a zealot like a Tim Sweeney guy who actually instigated the case, or just a developer or somebody who really believes in open source and that all of these closed platforms are fundamentally wrong and, “Here, see, this is why.”Or if you’re just trying to observe it neutrally, everybody’s looking at them and they’re like, “How do you not see how this is not going to fly?” And it makes you look terrible. It looks bad legally, it looks bad regulation-wise in places like the EU, and it absolutely looks terrible to whether you’re a developer who’s actually writing the code or you’re just a businessperson from a company who wants to have an app in the store and you’re looking at these terms. It looks terrible. Nobody wants to build on a platform where the starting point is a 70/30 split in 2025.Yeah. And you see all of the biggest new apps in the world debut as web apps on desktop, right? ChatGPT most often expressed to people is a web app on the desktop. And there’s something about that, that you would not have predicted at the dawn of the mobile age. In 2007 when the iPhone came out, in 2008 when the App Store released in particular, you would not say, “Okay, run it forward 15, 20 years. All the hottest new apps are going to come out as web apps on desktop computers.”You would not predict that but for Apple’s app store policies, which have prevented big sustainable businesses from being built in the app store. You know a lot of developers, a lot of developers read Daring Fireball. How would you characterize the reaction from developers after this ruling? Actually, what would you say was the general sentiment towards Apple leading up to this ruling? Because it has really changed a lot over the years, right?I think the reaction now is sort of, “Finally.” And I think there were a lot of people who read Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision, which I think also, I think you’re going to agree, she wrote.Yeah, she wrote the hell out of that thing, she wanted it to be read. But you get the feeling a lot of judges are issuing decisions right now they want to have read by regular people, and this is a highlight of that class.And there’s a very slight, it’s just a bit of lingo, it’s just, it’s a little formal. But when a ruling says, “The court,” and the court is uppercase, that means the judge. And every time you see her write, “The court,” you could just see, yeah, she’s like, “Fuck you for thinking you could do this in my court. Who do you think you are?” And I think a lot of developers read that, and they were like, “Finally, a court is just calling this out for what it is,” which is just sort of preposterous. And it’s been a long time and it has been a sort of, how long can the frog boil in the pot before it’s dead? It has been a very long time, but it really did shift from a scenario when the app store came out in 2008 and everybody who was around at the time, me and you writing about this stuff at the time, we remember the first year of the iPhone when there were no third-party apps.And for a couple of months, Steve Jobs was saying, “We don’t want third-party apps,” and they had their first WWDC when the iPhone came out, I guess right before it came out. And they were like, “We’ve got a sweet solution, it’s called web apps.” Which would’ve been, it wasn’t a way to make the apps that Apple itself was making for that first iPhone. So at an artistic level, developers weren’t happy about it because they’re like, “No, no, no, we want to use these Coco-like APIs. We want to use Objective-C and we want,” because those 2007 phones were relatively slow and memory was so concerned, “We want to do what you guys are doing and pack as much into as little code as possible to make it efficient and make something as beautiful and cool and smooth as what you’re making.” But what they were saying, if you just put aside the technical nature of it, was, “Hey, you could just build free apps and ship them however you want on the web the way you want.”Which again, here we are in 2025, and that is how developers are mostly choosing to launch new apps to consumers.Very much so. But now the technical differences are very different. It’s sort of switched around, but it’s really about the business differences. But when the actual app store opened the next year and the pitch was... And again, it’s all very simplistic compared to now, subscriptions weren’t a thing. It was really just paid apps where the app costs $5 or it was a free app, and if it was a free app, you didn’t have to pay anything other than your $100 a year developer account fee and Apple would take care of distributing the app. And if it was a paid app for $5, the split was 70/30, and that came from the music store, which was the deal over there. And compared to every other mobile platform of the time, a 70/30 split where the developer got the 70 was amazing.Compared to the carrier stores and all the other locked distribution methods.Right. So if you were writing on one of those Java platforms from 2006 on the then smartphones, 70/30 might be what you’re getting, but the carrier was taking 70 and you were getting 30 maybe. So 70/30 was a great deal. It was like, “Holy crap, we can write software for phones and people can use them wherever they are, they’re in their pocket. This is a great deal.” And the idea that here we are 18 years later and that’s still the deal, and I know there’s the small business platform, and if you have a subscription, it drops from 30 to 15 after a year and there’ve been some slight loosening of those terms, but for the most part it’s a 70/30 split.Eighteen years later with all of the two decades practically of innovation in online payments, Stripe wasn’t a company in 2007, this isn’t the world. And I know you’ve mocked this in your writing, I think they’ve sort of dropped this angle. Who knows, maybe their retort to YGR’s decision is going to go back to it. But just a couple years ago, they’d still come out with the whole buying software in boxes in retail stores and talking about the margins that developers got when people would go in a store and pick up a box and come home and put a disk in a computer to install software. And it’s like, I remember that, you remember that. A lot of people listening to this show remember that, but that was a long time ago.It’s interesting. I feel like that was a happier time for software development. It was over, there was no subscription fee. You had the product, you could use it however you want. If you wanted a new one, you could go buy it, and now everything is this relentless series of subscriptions and upsells. And I do feel like that is also Apple saying, “What we want you to do is turn your apps into subscription services so we can collect the revenue every quarter, so we can continue growing the services business where we’re doing very little.” I don’t think at this point, maybe in 2008, 2009, you could make a big argument that Apple was earning its 30 percent. They had the credit cards on file. They were doing the distribution, they had massive app store marketing campaigns. Every new iPhone owner was a potential new customer, and in a way that market is totally saturated now. I think it’s basically impossible to make the argument they’re earning their 30 percent now.But they are demanding the business models of the apps provide them with that 30 percent.And there’s no one point between 2008 and today where you could say, “Here’s the point, this decision in 2012 or in 2014 or whatever, that’s where it happened.” No, there’s no one point, but the fact is they never budged, right? And there is, at one point, it was in the Epic trial, but there was some old email from Phil Schiller circa 2010, where he ran up the flagpole internally, the idea that, “Hey, once our run rate, Apple’s cut of the app store reaches $1 billion a year, how about at that point we’ll just keep lowering the commission to keep it at... We’ll make $1 billion a year from the app store and go from 70/30 to 75/25 then to 80/20, and if it keeps growing and we keep making $1 billion, we’ll go to 80, just keep lowering it.” And it didn’t seem like anybody, there was evidence in there of anybody writing back, “Nah,” but it sure seems like the answer was, “Nah.”Well, here’s my question. And actually, it’s about Phil Schiller, who is as a character in Epic versus Apple in this case, talking about the services line, talking about these commissions for rates, keeps showing up as the one person who is saying what you are saying everyone else can see that Apple can’t see. “Hey, this is bad. Hey, we shouldn’t charge this commission. Hey, we shouldn’t play these games.” In these compliance meetings that Apple is having, which by the way, they started calling them Project Wisconsin, and I’m from Wisconsin, personally insulting to me.But that Project Wisconsin was, “How do we comply with the judge’s ruling?” And they landed on this back, literally reverse engineered 27 percent where they decided it was 27 percent. They went and hired a consulting firm to come up with some reasons and the judge sees right through it and says, “This is garbage, you just came up with this number.” In that process, Phil Schiller is saying we should just not charge a commission on the web. Why do you think he’s the character inside of Apple who had that realization, who could see the problem so clearly?By the way, just to put the stakes on for the audience, I should say there’s a meeting in which Apple’s CFO is arguing for commissions and Phil Schiller is arguing against them, and Tim Cook is the tiebreaker and picks commissions, he picks wrong. Literally, the ruling says, “Cook chose poorly.”Yeah, that is a direct quote, “Cook chose poorly.” It’s exactly like the line from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, where the guy drinks out of the wrong chalice. Although Tim Cook didn’t age 50 years and five seconds afterwards.Well, the second Trump got elected, I think he did. But anyway, go ahead. Why do you think Schiller is the character here who sees it?I think that it’s a couple of reasons, but I think that because Schiller was there for so long, he’s the only executive who was there when Steve Jobs and the next reunification, he was already there when they came back and obviously thrived. It was like, oh, he got along with Steve. But therefore remembers vividly what it was like when Apple was an underdog. And so many other people, Greg “Joz” Joswiak has been there for just as long. I think Joz has been there for 35, 40 years. So it’s like Joz remembers it, but Joz doesn’t seem to be a character in this story, right? Jaws is whatever, he’s a senior vice president of product marketing. He’s obviously very influential at Apple, but it doesn’t seem like he’s got anything to do with this app store stuff. There are a lot of people who were there then, but when the people remember being an underdog, I think they just have a different mindset of, “The only way we’re going to win is by making great stuff that people want to buy and that developers want to use.”And I think that two decades of this iPhone success has filled Apple’s ranks at a certain level with people who really just feel, “We can do this because what are they going to do, not make an iPhone app? We don’t have to compete.” And I’m sure they don’t say it that way. I’m sure they don’t say, “We don’t have to compete,” but they can say, “Why should we lower the rate? They have to come to us.” And I think Schiller remembers what that’s like. And Schiller, in between stints at Apple, he’d been at Macromedia and a couple of other companies. He knows what it was like to be an outside developer building for Windows and Mac.And I think he gets at a fundamental level, the sort of virtuous circle, the flywheel of, if you make a great platform that users and businesses want to pay for and that developers want to build for because they see the appeal of it and they see those users who are buying the product, and that developers are happy and keep making great stuff, and if you can get them to make stuff, if you can keep the platform going forward in an innovative way and Apple can invent things and do things and have features that other phones and other ecosystems don’t have, things like AirDrop, the continuity features between devices, these things are coming up in the EU as controversial.But if you can do these things and they’re exclusive to the platform and you can get developers to build on them, then the users see, “Oh, I’m going to keep buying this platform because I don’t want to lose these features that I can’t get anywhere else. And then you make new ones and then developers support those and users are like, “Oh, I’m going to keep buying this.” And it just keeps going for years and you’re making money and it just keeps working. And when you inject something in this that creates resentment, has entire fields of developers thinking, “How do we get out of this? How do we not pay Apple this exorbitant 30 percent cut? And how do we scheme?Maybe what we do is, instead of building native Mac apps for the desktop, we’re just going to go all in on the web and have people go through a browser,” and now they’re not building anything that is exclusive to your platform. And you could use any computer with a version of Chrome or Firefox or any leading browser and get the same experience for it. And if your top three or four apps that you use all work exactly the same, no matter which brand of computer you’re using, that whole flywheel is broken. And I think Schiller sees that, that you don’t have to squeeze every penny out of it. This is what’s so crazy about this, that the people who are really the angriest at Tim Cook over all of this think that because he comes from operations and has his mind on the finance and he’s not a product person. To his credit, has never pretended to be a product person, that he’s a penny-pincher. Now, Luca Maestri, the ex-CFO, he might be a penny pincher by all accounts, but Tim Cook isn’t, right? And Apple doesn’t pinch pennies in so many other ways. You can tell that they’ll go through dozens and dozens of hardware revisions to get the corner radius on the phone just right. They have metal engineers to create new custom versions of titanium to make the sides of the iPhone look the way they want using titanium to do this.They have great customer service still in the retail stores. They do all these things that other companies don’t do that clearly cost money, and do it because of the idea that, “Well, if we keep doing things as well as we can to make people happy, this will all work out in the end, and it seems like we’re making enough money,” but here on this Apple Store thing, they just want all the money and there’s no other way to look at it.Our friend Jason Snell has been sounding the alarm on services and Apple Store revenue for a long time. He’s written about it a lot at Six Colors, his site. I know you’ve talked about it with him, but I just have a quote from 2024 that I found. Here’s Jason. He says, “Services can never, ever take precedence over Apple’s hardware. If Apple ever begins to see its hardware as merely a vessel for selling more subscription services, the game will be over.” I look at this and I say, “Apple put up an executive to perjure himself in front of a judge about where the fake 27 percent came from and got caught.”That person has now been referred to the DOJ for criminal prosecution. Apple invented this 27 percent rationale, this fake compliance, maybe not malicious compliance, but certainly fake compliance. Apple looked at a court order that said, “You will not restrict buttons and links,” and came up with the most restrictive policy over what those buttons and links could look like, such that no one could ever possibly comply with them in a way that was good.There was a report that there were only 37 developers... I don’t know if this is true or not, but there’s a report the other day... I think MacRumors had it. Somebody’s filed a lawsuit that only 34 developers actually use those links.Out of hundreds of thousands of developers. I’ve never encountered one in the wild, have you? I use a lot of apps. The nature of my gig is, I try new apps. I have never seen an app in the United States that uses one of these link-out things…Right. Because you would take the discount from 30 to 27 and then you would immediately pay Stripe or whoever more. And sign up to have Apple auditing your books and all this stuff.So I’m just saying, you... I look at this line from Jason who’s been sounding this alarm for years, “Your dependency on a services line of business makes you a toll collector.” You’re the tax man now, and maybe the phones are great, but your priority is collecting the tax. And then you look at this court case and I can’t help but say, “Oh, they became the tax collector.” If they lose this, then maybe the whole game is up and they can’t keep funding the great customer service in the retail stores. By the way, I think some people might disagree with you, my wife would disagree with you, but whatever. They can’t keep funding their huge retail presence in all of their real estate investments. They can’t keep funding larks like the Vision Pro. The game is in this tax, this is the money because the iPhone isn’t growing and there might never be another product that scales like the iPhone.And my big point earlier was about the scale of the iPhone success and how distorting that unfathomable success must be, even to a company that I think was naturally resistant to the perverse effects of that sort of profitability, that they really were fundamentally driven by just making the coolest things, not by making the most money, but when you do make the most money, it just shifts your priorities. But the other factor was that point about 10 years ago where... I think it was around 2013 famously where Samsung was having a couple of good years. Steve Jobs had died two years prior and people were starting to call out, “See? They can’t do it without Steve Jobs.”And yeah, look, it’s going to happen. Same thing happened to the Mac versus the PC is happening with the iPhone. I think it was the same year where the Mac Pro came out and Phil Schiller said on stage, “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass.” Which is... That they were irritated by what people were saying about them. And that’s when Tim Cook started promoting this idea that we’re going to grow a very serious services business to... And it was a message not to consumers, right? Customers don’t care. They’re not telling customers, “Come into Apple and we’re going to charge you for…”Every time you look at your iPhone, that’ll be 30 percent. [Laughs]We’re going to get you to give us money every month. But he was telling Wall Street, “We’re going to build this business.” And there were a lot of people... And I had an open mind about it, but there were a lot of people who were extremely skeptical about the idea that Apple could do services, that they had any proficiency to build any kind of service, whether it was media services like selling Apple TV, which wasn’t a thing yet, or the music or whatever, or charging people for iCloud and email and stuff like that. But lo and behold, over the last 10-plus years they have built… And Snell’s been documenting it every single quarter. And that is a graph that does not fluctuate. It doesn’t go up and down. Sales go up and down based on things like when covid happened and there were supply-chain shortages. Over the years sales of iPhones and other hardware products sometimes fluctuate in places like China, which is the second-biggest market for Apple. But that services number is just like 5 percent up, 5 percent, up 5 percent up, 5 percent up. And now it’s this big thing.You don’t have to be a Wall Street expert to know that investors in general don’t really care about the fundamental nature of the business. A lot of people buy a little bit of Apple because they’re like, “I believe in the company. I think this is a company that I want to support. I think they have a good future. I understand that they make what they’re doing and I believe in the mission and think it has a bright future for a decade or two decades to come at least, I’m going to invest in them.” A lot of other people though just want to invest in companies that they think are growing. That’s it.And again, at a superficial level, you could say, “Well, they can make iPhones that start falling apart quicker,” but that doesn’t... Nobody at Apple thinks that way because they know that if you get irritated like, “Hey, I used to own my iPhones for four or five years and they were still great, just a little slow. And then I’d get a new one and it’s like, ‘Wow, the camera’s better. It’s a lot faster.’ And now I bought this phone two years ago and it’s falling apart.” That makes people think, “Maybe I should try a different brand.” Apple knows that, so they’re not going to do that. But with these long-lasting iPhones and with diminishing returns on chip performance at this point... And we see it with Apple Silicon in particular, the whole M1 series of Macs that started coming out at the end of 2020, they’re still great computers.Yeah, I have an M1 MacBook Pro, and I have no idea when I will ever have to replace it.Yeah, same here. And that is a real feather in the company’s cap that these devices last long and the performance is great like that, but how do you keep making the overall number keep going up? And the answer has been services, and that has twisted the company’s priorities. Clearly... They won’t admit it. I think you could hook Tim Cook up to a lie detector and he could pass it as saying, “No, our number one priority is not making services go up,” but look at their actions and I think it is.I want to draw a line from that attitude to your criticisms of how Apple launched Apple Intelligence and the big Siri demo, which was totally a concept video, and then recently they had to walk that back. I think you actually broke that story that Apple was going to walk that back, not launch those features this year. I don’t expect to see any new Siri features at WWDC. I think it’s beyond even that, right? That’s coming up in the next month or so, but I don’t think we’re going to hear a lot about it, right?No, I don’t think so either.The agentic Siri that they promised is really far in the future, and the reason I want to make this connection is, one, just hubris... Is this all just hubris? But secondly, to make that Siri work, they need a lot of goodwill from app developers because what they’re promising essentially is you will talk to your phone and then Siri will go use a bunch of your apps for you. And I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why developers who are this frustrated with Apple will let that happen. But beyond the technical difficulty of this, there’s just a, “Hey, DoorDash, will you let Siri just order a sandwich on your platform without anyone ever opening your app?” And I don’t... There’s not enough goodwill to broker that negotiation. And so it just seems to me like, “Yeah, there’s hubris. This is a company that thinks people have no choice,” as you’ve been saying. And then there’s, “Well, is anyone going to let this happen?”And it comes back to some of those things that I think Phil Schiller is keenly aware of, of getting developer buy-in for things that are specific to your platform. And these app-intense APIs are very specific to Apple’s platforms. I was going to say iOS, but they’re probably on the same APIs on macOS, too. But let’s just say for the Apple platforms that these app-intense APIs... And it doesn’t mean that if your company, Uber Eats or whoever or DoorDash, buys into it and supports these APIs, all of them as best they can and puts all of the stuff that they could do through app intents and supports them, it doesn’t mean that their Android app or their web version loses anything.But it is a resource allocation of engineering to, “Well, these features though are only for the people who are using our apps on Apple platforms. How much time do we want to spend on this?” versus, “Engineering effort that when we spend this effort on our own APIs on the web, they apply to everybody everywhere. We could do it once and it applies on the web and Android and iOS. How much effort do we want to put into something that is only for Apple’s efforts?” So in terms of the size of the audience, that’s still there, right? There still are a billion very desirable or over a billion very desirable iOS users out there. But then... And I think this is what you were hinting at, there’s the trust issue of, “Hey, they seem pretty greedy.” How much information that we consider competitive. And I don’t think they’re lying about the private nature of this, of app intents and that Apple would be seeing and hoovering up the collective data so that Apple can analyze it.But in the aggregate, it doesn’t really matter. If Apple can see that this is popular, they don’t need to take the private information from people’s DoorDash orders and analyze it. But they could see that maybe Apple should get into the food delivery business and it should be Apple Food, like Apple Pay. You laugh, but I mean, who would’ve thought 15 years ago that they would have a credit card? It’s not that crazy to think that there could be an Apple Food. Do you want to support a thing where they might become your rival? And I guess that’s really it. That’s where that... I think that’s what Schiller sees is that for almost all of these companies... Spotify’s an obvious counterexample because they’re up directly against Apple Music, but almost every other developer on the platform, the zillions of apps in the App Store, should not in theory see Apple as their competitor. They should see Apple as their partner and they should be like, “Yeah, this is a partner we really like working with.”They should be saying, I’m not saying they are, “But they have great software development tools. We really like their APIs. Our engineers who work on these platforms are really happy to be doing it. It’s really hard to hire engineers for this because it’s so competitive and that the talented engineers for the platform can go work anywhere they want. Users really value the native apps for this platform. We’re really happy to be here and we feel like we’re getting a great deal from them.” That’s the part that’s just missing now. What company thinks they’re getting a great financial deal from Apple right now with the App Store as it stands? I don’t know of anybody. Maybe some games, because games... The game industry is sort of 70/30 everywhere. Maybe.Well, I think games because again, like you said, it’s just gambling. They’re just happy the buttons are there, right? And you can get a lot of distribution. I mean, you look at the game economy, the games companies are hiring celebrities to make TikTok ads for free-to-play tower defense games. That’s a whole other episode of this show. The money there is a little out of control, and it is the thing that powers all of this. It’s not big business. I think Adobe and Microsoft were the big examples on the Mac, right? Microsoft, famously the first developer for the Mac, the first version of Microsoft Word comes out for the Mac. Excel was invented on the Mac.Excel was invented on the Mac. You just see these big classes of applications on desktop computers with the operating system as a very responsible layer that creates capabilities. But if you will recall, when Microsoft went to cross-platform interface elements in the early days of Word, the Mac community rebelled and said, “No, we want a bespoke version of Microsoft Word for the Mac.”Yeah, it was Word 6.0. And it took them years to recover from this self-imposed stain of ugly interface elements. All of that’s gone. The culture around Mac development and Apple development used to be, “This is the best. We’re going to make something at Apple’s level of quality.” And what you’re pointing out is it shifted really far. There isn’t. I mean, there is a small community of Apple indie developers, which are amazing, but it’s still shifted really far. Do you think that’s recoverable?I do think it’s recoverable, but I think it should have become a red flag issue at least five-plus years ago within Apple, like, “We need to turn this around and make it more of a thing.” And you can kind of see it on iOS, where... And this would be my existence proof that it’s recoverable, and it’s... Say what you want about the aesthetics of the iOS 7 flattened redesign from now, I guess, what, about 10 years ago, 11 years ago. But part of that wasn’t just Jony Ive wanting to get rid of those ‘skeuomorphic’ leather and texture and brushed metal and 3D buttons and stuff. But part of it was a concerted effort to get developers to stop making apps that the entire brand of the app looked like the brand of the company and kind of get apps that all look, “Oh yeah, that’s an iOS app.”You still see some apps that don’t look iOSey at all. But for the most part, most apps on iOS are very consistent with the platform. It’s the Mac that’s lost that to a large degree. There are a lot of native third-party apps, but it isn’t a growing market. And Apple should see that as a five-alarm fire, in my opinion. Not because the Mac is that particularly big compared to iOS, but because it is the platform that makes the platforms, it’s... All iOS apps are made on a Mac and it doesn’t seem to be of concern to Apple. And to me, it is unusual. It’s why I love ChatGPT because the ChatGPT Mac app is actually a really good and clever Mac app that does really interesting Mac things, like it knows about BBEdit. And so if you’re using BBEdit while you use ChatGPT, they’re like, “Hey, do you want me to hook up to this script that you’re writing in that front BBEdit window, yes or no?” And if you do, then it’s like, oh, and now you can just type commands, like how do I make this script do X? And ChatGPT can do that. You can’t do that through the web connected to a native Mac app. And it knows about all the other popular text editors on the Mac too.What’s interesting is Open AI does a lot of work with Jony Ive and Jony Ive’s new design firm. And you can just see, some of this DNA is coming through. When I say it’s recoverable, there’s the, is it recoverable, can you make an interesting platform? Can you attract the trust of developers? Then there’s the, can you deliver on what you say you’re going to deliver? And to me, that comes back to hubris, right? That’s the concept video at WWDC sewing off a Siri that I think even the Siri team had not known was going to be, to show it off.Yeah, so we’ve learned since. What do you think that says about Apple right now? I mean, you’ve written about this at length that heads should have rolled for this.Well, and I think they kind of are, but in a very Tim Cook quiet-ish way that he does not like, I don’t think, external drama. I don’t think Steve Jobs did either, but I don’t think Steve Jobs cared, and I think when he got emotional, he just got emotional. I still don’t know. And there’s been so much reporting that’s come out in the last, I guess it’s about two months now, but Wayne Ma at The Information had a bunch of good stuff. Mark Gurman always has lots of little nuggets here and there in his reporting at Bloomberg. I still don’t know what they were thinking in June when they announced it. In the back of my head, I kind of feel like it’s another case where, and again, I’m not saying that the guy should be fired for it, Tim Cook, but I kind of feel like the buck stops there. And obviously, some number of people at Apple are like, yes, we can build this, these Siri features and ship them by next year. Right? It would be insane.And some of the pushback I got to my piece, “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino,” was on the grounds of insinuating that they were dishonest about it, that this was fraudulent. And I didn’t mean to imply that, and I don’t quite see, I guess, I didn’t explicitly state that they weren’t lying about thinking they could ship it because it seemed so obvious to me that of course they weren’t lying. Of course some number of people there thought they were going to ship that within the next eight months because it would look terrible if they didn’t and then they didn’t and it looks terrible. So, of course they didn’t. And famously, Apple’s leadership is extremely stable. Everybody there has been there for a long time. It’s not like it’s a fly-by-night job where there were people pushing for, “Yeah, let’s lie and say Siri will do X, Y, and Z by next year because I won’t even be here by next year. I’ll cash out in April and go work at Meta or Google or whatever.” No, they’re all still there.So of course some number of people believed it was going to ship, but there also had to be other voices in the company saying, “I don’t know if we’re going to be able to ship this in the next year,” or, “I don’t think we’re going to be able to ship this in the next year.” And at the very least, “I don’t think we should tell people in June of 2024 that we are going to ship it in the next year. Let’s get closer to shipping it before we announce it. We don’t have to wait until it’s ready, but we should be a lot closer to ready before we tell people this.” I don’t know. I think that maybe, I know it’s an overused phrase, but that they’re sort of high on their own supply, where for so many years they’ve said and when they’ve gotten a little bit out over their skis of, this isn’t quite ready, but I think there were people inside the company who were effectively willing to bet their careers, but we can make this work.So with these advanced Siri features, why in the world in June last year when they clearly at this point we now know they weren’t even within a year of being able to ship. So I don’t know what their most optimistic scenario was then, but why wasn’t the internal discussion, “Well, let’s table this for now and maybe if over the summer we get closer, maybe we can announce this at the iPhone event in September,” which I don’t know if you know, a lot of people pay attention to.I will point out that a lot of people have announced Agentic AI systems, they can click around on websites and do it for you. None of them work to any great effect. Amazon announced Alexa+, approximately zero people have it. They launched it, they said it was out from what we can tell, 100,000 no ones have it. There’s some number of people who have it, but it’s no one that anyone knows.So, it does seem much harder than it looks. But what I would connect this to, and I think we should end here. This is like, where does Apple go? Right? Here’s all of this pressure on manufacturing, on supply chains, on revenue. Right? The only growing line of revenue, like you said, it’s just a linear lineup. 20 billion, 25 billion is going away. Maybe we prompt the whales to come to the private rooms and take a little bit of that money away too. That’s a lot of pressure, but it seems like where Apple has been good for years, decades now, is relentless linear improvement.You once wrote a very famous post called “This is How Apple Rolls,” right?And they just, relentless improvement. Every year it’s a little bit better. And if you can start somewhere and you can get to the finish line, Apple’s going to get to that finish line. And it seems like what they’ve missed is any disruptive change. Right? And I think to whatever extent AI is a disruptive change, it’s a disruptive change to the interface of computers. You can just talk to the computer and then the computer will tell you to leave your wife, and that is going to change how we think about computers. I don’t know if they’re alive or conscious or whether they’re going to AGI, but the idea that we can just have a conversation with a computer or maybe it’s going to do some stuff, that’s the change.And here Apple, instead of understanding the technology, announced what it might do, instead of saying, “Okay, here’s how we can get from A to B and from B to C.” I think you can see it with the Vision Pro too, right? They wanted to build true AR glasses and they couldn’t. They didn’t have the capability or this technology in there so they built this big VR headset and it hasn’t taken off because you can’t see how that thing improves in a relentless linear way to the actual goal. And I’m just wondering if you think the Tim Cook Apple, all this relentless optimization, all this relentless increase of revenue, whether you think culturally it can make a big disruptive change like that.I think they can. I think though that it’s very odd to me that they seemed... And I am sure every single person involved, if they jumped into this podcast with us, would say, “We didn’t panic at all. We weren’t panicked.” But it looks to me like last year’s WWDC was a panicked announcement of, we keep hearing AI, AI, AI. We’re going to announce that we can do all these amazing things that nobody else can. And it turns out, nobody can do them, including Apple. Right? So, why announce them?And I feel like it’s so early days for AI. I know that it’s so exciting and these models keep improving and there’s so much going on. But I think when you zoom out and look at, how is it really, what are the products that are driven by this? We don’t see it yet. It may just be a handful of years, but the product is not going to be the ChatGPT app. ChatGPT app isn’t going anywhere, that’s like the terminal. So running programs in a terminal app is still a thing today, even exactly... Would be very similar to somebody from 1973 at Xerox PARC. They could sit down in front of the terminal app and be like, “Oh yeah, it’s still got VI and lots of stuff is similar.” It’s like, oh wow, look how much faster this is. ChatGPT is like that. It’s not going anywhere. We’ll have it forever for doing the things where you actually chat to somebody.Chat turns out to be a great interface. Right? This is how me and you, 98 percent of the year, two days a year, we see each other and we pal around and we have lunch and we’re in meetings together or a podcast together, and then the other 97 percent of the days, me and you are friends by text, right? It’s a great interface. It is, but it’s limiting. There are going to be interfaces that are to chat to interface with AI, what graphical user interface apps are to command line apps. I don’t know what they are yet. Nobody does. I don’t think we’ve seen them.I think the one that’s obvious, people talk about it, I don’t know why people laugh. It is obviously going to happen. We want robots. We want C-3PO and R2-D2 style robots in our life who can walk around our house and go get us drinks from the refrigerator and go answer the doorbell because I’m expecting a FedEx package and the robot will go down there and answer. We want these things and what’s the... We’re going to talk to them. Apple can make physical devices better than anybody. Right? That’s part of the play, right? So to me, the thing that I don’t see why Apple’s panicked is that the real play is going to come when AI informs the fundamental physical nature of certain devices. Right? It’s not going to be these slabs of glass, the phones and the tablets, it’s not going to be laptops. We have the interfaces for them and now they’re all decades old. There will be new physical devices that you buy that are AI first, and again, they’re not going to be pins that you wear [inaudible 01:07:07].But that’s where that entire class of devices came from. Right?People thought, okay, voice is the dominant interface. If I redesign the phone to be voice first, maybe I’m going to throw the screen away and pin it to your chest.But the AI wasn’t ready, those products just didn’t work.That’s where Apple should just have the quiet confidence and to start noodling on those ideas of, what can we build? Can we build a robot that can go up and down stairs? What else can we do? Can we do something? There’s so many different ideas that are possible and I think we’ll start seeing them soon, but Apple should be thinking that. What are the physical devices that are informed by this and how can we build them as quickly as possible? I mean, that’s probably why they had that experiment with the car. The car was, and by all descriptions of Apple’s car project was sort of... Some people within Apple apparently only wanted to do it if it could be entirely self-driving, right? That it was an AI product in a certain sense. And I don’t even know that it was wasted money.I think you have to, if you don’t have failures, you’re not trying hard enough. If every single thing you try to do you succeed at, then you’re not trying hard enough. You need, I don’t know what the right batting average is, but you have a couple of, to be pushing so close to the edge of what’s possible that sometimes it’s not going to pan out, and Apple should get back to that. But promising things that aren’t within months of shipping shouldn’t ever be part of the recipe. And I don’t think, it’s going to be a long time before they recover from that.And then the other thing they should be thinking about recovering is getting developers outside Apple to want to make software for Apple devices. To be dying, to be begging their boss like, “Let us make a native app for this whatever.” Whether it’s the iPhone, the Mac, or a new device or something, and having the boss say, “Well, what’s in it for the company?” And say, “Oh, it’s a great deal,” and to have it actually seem like a great deal. You know?Yeah, or it’s something we can go tell our customers about that we can only do on the Mac or only do on the iPhone, which at this point is pretty limited.But John, we got to wrap this up. First of all, I just want to say one thing. Every time I think about the Apple car, I think about the fact that the most popular cars in America are midsize crossovers, and imagining Jony Ive trying to design a midsize crossover is just the funniest.No wonder that project failed. What, Jony Ive’s going to compete with the Mazda CX-5? Get out of here, it’s just not happening. But that piece about developers is really important. And I’m just curious, I mean we’re coming up in WWDC, do you think they’re going to acknowledge these missteps and apologize and try to reset those relationships?Well, maybe on the developer terms, and I don’t have any insider information about it, and if it is going to happen, I’ll bet you could fit them in a midsize crossover SUV. The number of actual people involved who know what Apple’s going to announce would fit in a Mazda CR whatever.Yeah, not even the three-row one, the two-row one.But I think that they could, and it’s a very Apple way. Steve Jobs was the master of this, of saying, they’d say, “Hey, do you think anybody ever wants to watch video on an iPod?” And he’d say, “No, that’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard in my life.” And then the next year, the video, the iPod plays video. And come out and say, “Hey, we had this great idea. How about we cut the rate of the app store to 85–15 from... It just popped into our head and we thought, and some kind of Apple explanation for why now’s the time to do it, without acknowledging that they lost a court case, without acknowledging any regulatory pressure from other countries around the world. Just act like it popped into their head and it’ll make a certain segment of the internet’s heads explode because they’re pretending that they just came up with this original, amazing idea of only taking 10 percent of digital transactions or whatever the number would be, and acting like they invented it. But that’s Apple. They could do it. There’s nothing that’s stopping them from doing it.And I do think, just one quick point. I’m sure you remember this guy, Arthur Laffer, he’s still around, but he’s the guy from the Laffer curve that fueled the whole supply-side economics idea. And the idea is that if the government charged lower tax rates, they’d make more money because the economy would grow. At a certain level, and Republicans sort of took it to an absurd degree, but at a certain level it is true. It has to be true, because if the government taxed your income 100 percent, well, nobody would work. Why would you work if they’re taking 100 percent of your money? And if the government taxed you at 0 percent, the government would make no money. So there has to be a magic number in between zero and 100 that is about the optimal amount of money that people are inspired to work the most, and then the government makes the most money because the economy is growing.The number for Apple has to be different from 70–30, but they’ve somehow started thinking, “Why would we lower it at all? We’ll lose money.” But they’re clearly, they’ve lost so much money because people aren’t building for the platform and they don’t see it. It’s bananas.I would tell you, having talked to a number of antitrust regulators in the show, the idea that we would take tax policy and apply it to a company is the problem that they see. Right? They’re like, “Apple’s a state. Apple has government problems. Apple has tax policy problems.” The market should be setting the rate. Right? Apple should say, “Our developers are leaving and going to develop for Microsoft or Google or whoever, and that is bringing the rate down, not us, the regulator.”And this is, now we’ve just entered into pure Decoder land, but what is the optimal tax rate for a platform is, in the Laffer curve is deep. We’re going to have to come back after WWDC and talk about it because I’m very curious what they do here especially, and we don’t know yet if more developers take advantage of this moment when the judge has said, “You’re not doing this anymore.” And they’re adding the buttons, right? They’re adding the buttons to take people to the web, but Apple’s appealed that ruling. There’s this weird A–B test that is about to happen.The most innovative thing to happen so far in May 2025 is that the Kindle app now has a get book button in.Innovation, Nilay, innovation. Do you see what I’m saying? This is what they would say the problem with the monopolies are. But John, you’re going to have to come back. I’m dying to see what happens to developers. I’m dying to see what happens with WWDC. It seems like, like I said at the top, whatever we think of these big companies right now, the status quo is not holding, right?Things are changing. And I think in particular for Apple, the soul of the company is either going to persist and win or something else is going to happen.So from our perspective in the media, they have done their job of making this year’s WWDC something that seems like it’s going to be dramatic.I hope so. We’ll see. All right, John, thank you so much for being on Decoder, we’ll have to have you back soon.Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Now newly un… [+3414 chars],"Below is a video of the Oligo researchers demonstrating their AirBorne hacking technique to take over an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker to show their company’s logo for AirBorne. (The researchers say they didn’t intend to single out Bose, but just happened to have one of the company’s speakers on hand for testing.) Bose did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment.The AirBorne vulnerabilities Oligo found also affect CarPlay, the radio protocol used to connect to vehicles’ dashboard interfaces. Oligo warns that this means hackers could hijack a car’s automotive computer, known as its head unit, in any of more than 800 CarPlay-enabled car and truck models. In those car-specific cases, though, the AirBorne vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the hacker is able to pair their own device with the head unit via Bluetooth or a USB connection, which drastically restricts the threat of CarPlay-based vehicle hacking.The AirPlay SDK flaws in home media devices, by contrast, may present a more practical vulnerability for hackers seeking to hide on a network, whether to install ransomware or carry out stealthy espionage, all while hiding on devices that are often forgotten by both consumers and corporate or government network defenders. “The amount of devices that were vulnerable to these issues, that's what alarms me,” says Oligo researcher Uri Katz. “When was the last time you updated your speaker?”The researchers originally started thinking about this property of AirPlay, and ultimately discovered the AirBorne vulnerabilities, while working on a different project analyzing vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access internal services running on a target’s local network from a malicious website. In that earlier research, Oligo’s hackers found they could defeat the fundamental protections baked into every web browser that are meant to prevent websites from having this type of invasive access on other people’s internal networks.While playing around with their discovery, the researchers realized that one of the services they could access by exploiting the bugs without authorization on a target’s systems was AirPlay. The crop of AirBorne vulnerabilities revealed today is unconnected to the previous work, but was inspired by AirPlay’s properties as a service built to sit open and at the ready for new connections.And the fact that the researchers found flaws in the AirPlay SDK means that vulnerabilities are lurking in hundreds of models of devices—and possibly more, given that some manufacturers incorporate the AirPlay SDK without notifying Apple and becoming “certified” AirPlay devices.“When third-party manufacturers integrate Apple technologies like AirPlay via an SDK, obviously Apple no longer has direct control over the hardware or the patching process,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “As a result, when vulnerabilities arise and third-party vendors fail to update their products promptly—or at all—it not only puts users at risk but could also erode trust in the broader Apple ecosystem.""Updated 10 am ET, April 29, 2024: Clarified that the logo in Oligo's video is for AirBorne, not the company itself.",Wired

Those changes—and a promised World-branded debit card—signal the company’s ambitions to develop a “super app”—a goal shared by Elon Musk.Altman and Alex Blania, a German physics researcher, announced at an event in San Francisco Wednesday evening that their venture-backed company, Tools for Humanity, is updating its “World” products to include a new, smaller, eye-scanning orb. The device-and-app combo scans people’s irises, creates a unique user ID, stores that information on the blockchain, and uses it as a form of identity verification. If enough people adopt the app globally, the thinking goes, it could ostensibly thwart scammers.Altman has expressed concern about the amount of fakery that new AI tools will enable, including the generative AI tools pioneered by his other startup, OpenAI, which is valued at $300 billion. So the World app, and its hardware component, are Altman’s solution to the problem.“Proving personhood” is a hard thing to productize, and whiffs of a scam have plagued the startup since it launched. The project has also been scrutinized by foreign governments for its biometric data-capture and storage policies. But Altman and Blania haven’t been deterred.The bizarre identity verification process requires that users get their eyeballs scanned, so Tools for Humanity is expanding its physical footprint to make that a possibility. The company will open six Apple-like stores in cities across the US, including one in San Francisco, where the floor around a wooden structure holding about eight orbs was being polished on Wednesday night. The orbs will also be accessible in Razer stores. Future scanning sites could include cafes and college campuses, the company said.World first launched as Worldcoin in July 2024, the brainchild of Altman, Blania, and Max Novendstern, who is no longer at the company. Blania serves as CEO, while Altman remains his most prominent backer. As of March 2025 the company had raised $240 million in venture capital funding from big-name firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Bain Capital, and Coinbase Ventures, as well as individual investors like Reid Hoffman and the now-imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried.World’s network of users has “nearly doubled” in size in the last six months to roughly 26 million, the startup claims, and 12 million users have been verified with the orb. The company says it expects to generate revenue starting later this year through fees paid by apps that benefit from having users' identities verified.At the event on Wednesday—in a crowd filled with founders, engineers, and paid-to-attend-influencers—World said that it’s opening an Orb assembly line in Richardson, Texas with a US manufacturer, and estimates there will be a total of “7,500 orbs across the US by the end of this year.” But World wants to scale it beyond that, it said, and put more orbs “in the hands of the people.”",Wired

Daring Fireball’s John Gruber spotted that a red exclamation mark icon is being prominently displayed on the App Store listing for Instacar, alongside a message warning users that it doesn’t use Apple’s “private and secure payment system.”Instacar, a three-year-old Hungarian app for checking the mileage and value of used cars, isn’t available on the US App Store. But in Hungary, in the EU, it’s listed as one of the top five apps in the Business category, with thousands of positive reviews — not a typical service that would warrant heightened caution. The only gripe that Apple seemingly has is that Instacar uses an external payment system, and that App Store payment features like purchase history, Family Sharing, and unified subscription management won’t be available on such purchases.The warning message isn’t actually new, having been in place since Apple started complying with the EU’s Digital Markets Act in March 2024. It likely only just appeared on some people’s radar because, dissuaded by Apple’s onerous implementation rules, very few EU apps have actually implemented external payments — fewer than 100, according to Revenue Cat CEO Jacob Eiting. Apple did propose changing the warning banner in August to replace the red “!” logo with a less threatening “i” and show a slightly different message, but the EU hasn’t yet approved the updated design.“When you create an account on a developer’s external website, you may have to provide personal information, including payment information, directly to the developer or third-party partners,” Apple says in a support page linked from its warning message. “You will be trusting the developer, as well as any partners and payment providers they work with, to handle your information based on their privacy and security controls.”Apple is currently facing heat in the EU for its practices around scare tactics. In April, the European Commission issued preliminary findings that Apple “makes it overly burdensome and confusing” for users to install alternative app marketplaces, a process that involves clicking through several scare sheets that ask users to confirm if they want to proceed. This App Store warning message is also blowing up in the wake of the recent Epic vs Apple ruling that bans Apple from restricting how developers can link to alternative purchase systems. A notable requirement implemented to address Apple’s scare tactics was that the company cannot interfere with consumers choosing to leave an app with anything beyond “a neutral message” about being directed to a third-party site, though that injunction doesn’t apply outside of the US.Update, May 16th: added more information about when the warning banner was implemented.",The Verge

And users can turn the service on in Apple’s end-to-end encrypted communication app, Messages, to generate message summaries and compose “Smart Reply” messages on both iPhones and Macs.Looking at Private Cloud Compute and Private Processing side by side is like comparing, well, Apple(s) and oranges, though. Apple’s Private Cloud Compute underpins all of Apple Intelligence everywhere it can be applied. Private Processing, on the other hand, was purpose-built for WhatsApp and doesn’t underpin Meta’s AI features more broadly. Apple Intelligence is also designed to do as much AI processing as possible on-device and only send requests to the Private Cloud Compute infrastructure when necessary. Since such “on device” or “local” processing requires powerful hardware, Apple only designed Apple Intelligence to run at all on its recent generations of mobile hardware. Old iPhones and iPads will never support Apple Intelligence.Apple is a manufacturer of high-end smartphones and other hardware, while Meta is a software company, and has about 3 billion users who have all types of smartphones, including old and low-end devices. Rohlf and Colin Clemmons, one of the Private Processing lead engineers, say that it wasn’t feasible to design AI features for WhatsApp that could run locally on the spectrum of devices WhatsApp serves. Instead, WhatsApp focused on designing Private Processing to be as unhelpful as possible to attackers if it were to be breached.“The design is one of risk minimization,” Clemmons says. “We want to minimize the value of compromising the system.”The whole effort raises a more basic question, though, about why a secure communication platform like WhatsApp needs to offer AI features at all. Meta is adamant, though, that users expect the features at this point and will go wherever they have to to get them.“Many people want to use AI tools to help them when they are messaging,” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart told WIRED in an email. “We think building a private way to do that is important, because people shouldn’t have to switch to a less-private platform to have the functionality they need.”“Any end-to-end encrypted system that uses off-device AI inference is going to be riskier than a pure end to end system. You’re sending data to a computer in a data center, and that machine sees your private texts,” says Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptographer who previewed some of the privacy guarantees of Private Processing, but hasn’t audited the complete system. “I believe WhatsApp when they say that they’ve designed this to be as secure as possible, and I believe them when they say that they can’t read your texts. But I also think there are risks here. More private data will go off device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation state adversaries.”WhatsApp says, too, that beyond basic AI features like text summarization and writing suggestions, Private Processing will hopefully create a foundation for expanding into more complicated and involved AI features in the future that involve processing, and potentially storing, more data.As Green puts it, “Given all the crazy things people use secure messengers for, any and all of this will make the Private Processing computers into a very big target.”",Wired

A support page added to Apple’s website this week includes details on how to use the feature, as spotted by MacRumors, but it also points out that it’s currently only available in Australia and New Zealand, with no details on when it might be available in more countries.The transfer can be started from in the iPhone, iPad, and Android versions of the Apple Music mobile app, but also using the streaming service’s web interface. “You can transfer your songs, albums, and playlists from other music services to Apple Music, but what you can transfer varies by service,” according to Apple’s support page. For example, you can only transfer playlists you created. “Playlists created by the music service won’t transfer.”The feature is available in the Apps > Music section of iOS’ and iPadOS’ Settings app, or through the settings directly inside the Apple Music app on Android. Tapping ‘Transfer Music from Other Music Services’ brings up a list of supported third party services, which will then require you to provide your login details before you’re given options of what you want transferred.If an exact match for a song can’t automatically be found in the Apple Music catalog, you’ll be warned that “Some Music Needs Review” and will be prompted to select alternate versions to add to your library. You have just 30 days from when you started the transfer to review unmatched songs, and, according to Apple’s support page, you won’t be able to start a new transfer until the previous review is completed.Apple partnered with the creators of SongShift for the new feature, but it’s still available as a standalone app since it also allows for library and playlist transfers between other streaming services including Spotify, Deezer, LastFM, Tidal, YouTube, and Pandora – not just to Apple Music.",The Verge

Microsofts Bing or DuckDuck… [+5172 chars]","Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo probably won’t disrupt Google’s dominance in search, said Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue — but AI services easily could.Cue was returning to a courtroom in Washington, DC where he last testified in the Justice Department’s trial against Google’s search monopoly in September 2023. During the current remedies trial on Wednesday, Cue said that in the time since, well-funded generative AI upstarts have made such significant advancements that they could ultimately disrupt that monopoly — perhaps more effectively than the court could. Cue was also, however, there to defend a significant source of Apple’s revenue: the payments Google offers for default search engine placement on Apple’s Safari browser.After the 2023 trial, Judge Amit Mehta found that Google illegally monopolized the online search market, in part through agreements like the Safari deal. For the last two and a half weeks, Google and the DOJ have pitched Mehta on what he should (or shouldn’t) do to fix the problem. The DOJ says Google should be forced to share valuable search data with competitors and spin off its Chrome browser, while Google (which plans to appeal the earlier ruling) wants only restrictions on the deals Mehta deemed unfairly exclusionary. And rather than barring its Apple deal altogether, it would make Google give Apple more flexibility to sign additional default search agreements across its various devices or in private browsing mode. Cue argued Wednesday that rapid AI advancements mean the antitrust threat Mehta identified is shrinking. For the first time in 22 years, Cue said, Apple saw search volume decline in its Safari browser last month — a side effect of users seeking more information from AI chatbots. The DOJ, unsurprisingly, disagrees. It’s not uncommon for technological development to outpace the slow trudge of the court system, but the government says that pace isn’t fast enough to fix a persistent market issue.Apple has a lot of skin in the game here — the DOJ previously revealed it rakes in $20 billion in payments from Google annually. Google’s proposed remedies could reduce it, but they would also open up Apple’s options and preserve much of its revenue flow. The DOJ’s, meanwhile, could wipe out that cash flow altogether. Cue seemed bewildered that Apple could get the short end of the stick for a punishment supposedly inflicted on Google. The idea that the court could decide Google did something wrong and then let it save money at Apple’s expense, he said, “just seems crazy to me.”Google could even keep its prime Safari placement without a deal in the short term, Cue said. “We don’t really have a choice today,” he testified. Even if Apple could cut a new default deal with another company, Google is still the best service available for customers, so they’d probably seek it out — and Apple wouldn’t get a cut. Cue said he’s “lost a lot of sleep” over the prospect of losing the Google deal, and warned it would impact Apple’s ability to make new products. Cue also told Mehta he “can’t say I disagree” with his analysis that Apple was disincentivized from building its own search engine because of its deal with Google. But, he added, “we can’t do everything,” and since Google is really good at what it does, Apple prefers to focus on areas where it can offer unique value. There’s “much greater potential because there are new entrants that are attacking the problem in a different way”AI could eventually change all of this, Cue testified. Apple is already exploring adding AI search options, though it recognizes they can’t yet replace traditional search engines. “To date, they’re just not good enough,” he said.Cue said “good enough” could come sooner than he anticipated. He said there’s “much greater potential because there are new entrants that are attacking the problem in a different way.” Large language model (LLM) AI companies haven’t built a robust enough search index to substitute for Google yet, he said, but combining an LLM with search could let them use a smaller index effectively soon. Even though he is backing Google’s fight to keep its search deals, he seemed to acknowledge that the DOJ’s proposal to syndicate Google’s search index could get AI rivals up to speed even faster. Cue cautioned the judge that tech is not like other industries, and giants often fall even without court intervention. “When I got to Silicon Valley, all of the best companies, or the most successful companies, either don’t exist today or are significantly smaller and less impactful,” Cue said, pointing to companies like HP, Sun Microsystems, and Intel. In the technology field, being an incumbent might not offer the same benefits it does in other markets. “We’re not an oil company, we’re not toothpaste. These are things that are going to last forever,” he said. “You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.” After nearly four decades at Apple, Cue now sees AI as “a huge technological shift.”Putting himself in the judge’s shoes, Cue told Mehta, “we’re lucky, because honestly, if AI had not come about, I don’t know what you could do.” That’s because, he explained, “until there are truly competitive products, people will keep using the best one.”",The Verge
33,Raymond Wong,Nobody’s Asking for Unnecessarily Skinny iPhones or Samsung Galaxy Phones,There are so many other ways Apple and Samsung could make phones better instead of just making them thinner.,https://gizmodo.com/nobodys-asking-for-unnecessarily-skinny-iphones-or-samsung-galaxy-phones-2000596535,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/iphone17air.jpg,2025-04-30T19:23:53Z,Smartphones were bound to get boring.

Eighteen years after the introduction of the original iPhoneâthe glass touchscreen that truly changed everythingâthereâs very little with new phones that will get people camping out just to be the first to get The Next Big Thing. Foldable phones have tried to rekindle some of that old excitement, but theyâre still too expensive. So phone makers are trying something new: super skinny phones. Both Samsung and Apple will be launching extremely thin phones by the end of this year. Samsung already announced its Galaxy S25 Edge, and Apple, the copious leaks plastered all over the internet strongly suggest, will release what everybodyâs calling the âiPhone 17 Airâ alongside its stable of regular and pro-tier iPhone 17s. Numerous leaked images of dummy units reveal the S25 Edge and iPhone 17 Air to be barely thicker than the USB-C port. Prolific phone leaker Evan Blass shared last week that the S25 Edge measures only 5.8mm thick and weighs 165 grams. Several well-known Apple leakers, including Bloombergâs Mark Gurman, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and YouTubers such as Unbox Therapy, all corroborate that the iPhone 17 Air will clock in somewhere around 5.5mm to 6mm thick. YouTuber Sam Kohl, who runs the Apple Track channel, has an extensive video showing off a dummy model for the iPhone 17 Air and how it compares to the rest of Apple’s family of iPhone 17 devices slated for launch in September.

   Had phones stayed skinny like they were way back with the iPhone 6 released in 2014, and had bendgate never happened, nobody would be making such a hoopla over thin phones. But thatâs not what happened. As phones got bigger screens, cameras upgraded from single lenses to dual or triple ones, and apps (especially 3D mobile games) needed more powerful chips, there was only one way to make them last a whole day, and that was shoving a bigger battery inside. The downside to longer-lasting but physically bigger batteries is that phones ballooned in thickness to fit them. Phone makers gave the people exactly what they voted for with their walletsâphone addiction be damnedâand now theyâre trying to sell lesser phones just for the sake of slimness. Is anybody really asking for a phone that could snap in half like a candy bar if you grip it too hard or slip it into a pair of tight jeans? Even a guy like me who hates how impossible it is to one-hand my iPhone 16 Pro and would greatly appreciate a thinner and lighter iPhone is wondering whether the tradeoffs will be worth it. A thinner phone means a smaller battery. You also get fewer rear cameras, as evidenced by the S25 Edge and leaked iPhone 17 Airâs single lenses. Technology has come a long way since bendgate over a decade ago. Chipsets are more efficient and less power-hungry, so you donât need massive batteries for phone basics like doomscrolling on TikTok, email, and web browsing. And you can now get a lot out of a single camera lensâlike multiple focal lengths that simulate different zoom levels by cropping inâif the sensor has lots of megapixels. But I worry that the mass and weight loss may not be worth these compromises. At the end of the day, both Samsung and Appleâs skinny phones will still have big honking screens roughly measuring 6.6 inches, and they wonât fit in any pair of reasonable pants pockets. Sorry, dude who only owns one pair of jeans and has the outline of their phone permanently imprinted into the front pocket!

 VIDEO The initial media and influencer buzz will treat these phones like they’re the Second Coming of Jesus, but after the frenzy subsides, will anybody care? Will the sales numbers bear out any demand for super-thin phones? We wonât know until hindsight, but if rumored prices end up being correct, they might be a tough sell. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman believes Apple could sell the iPhone 17 Air starting at $900, which would only be $100 more than the iPhone 17 and $100 less than the iPhone 17 Pro. Thatâs also only if Apple sticks to the pricing for the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro and doesnât increase prices because of tariffs. Other rumors have suggested Apple could sell the iPhone 17 Air for more than the smaller iPhone 17 Pro. Meanwhile, Samsungâs S25 Edge could be very pricey, too. A leak reportedly from Samsung itself suggests the skinny device could start at around $1,200. How willing will people be to pay up just to show off they have the thinnest Samsung Galaxy or iPhone 17? In this economy and with tariffs threatening consumerism as we know it? Good luck, guys. Also, slap a case on the thin iPhone, and you’re back to having a regular-thick iPhone with none of the better features. I think Iâve made my point. But letâs say that both these skinny phones are recession-proof and theyâre a hit. I still think that phone makers should prioritize more meaningful features instead of simply pushing out outrageously thinner ones. How about Apple shipping the awesome anti-glare displaysâthe same ones that Samsungâs been using in its Galaxy Ultra phonesâthat greatly cut down on reflections outdoors? Apple was supposedly going to give the iPhone 17 Pro screens this tech but scrapped it for some reason. Or how about cameras that actually blow away the ones from Chinese brands like Oppo and Xiaomi? (Americans have no idea how much better the cameras are on phones like the Oppo Find X8 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra.) Or how about ridiculously fast wired charging that can take your phone from 0% to 100% in 10 minutes? There are just so many ways that phones from Apple and Samsung have been leapfrogged by other brands, especially ones that donât sell their devices outside of China or Asia, that the last thing anybody needs is a Really Thin Phone.",Gizmodo.com
34,Cheryl Eddy,"Murderbot Is a Funny, Violent Exploration of What It Means to Be Human",Martha Wells’ much-loved sci-fi book series gets a top-notch adaptation starring Alexander Skarsgård on Apple TV+.,https://gizmodo.com/murderbot-review-alexander-skarsgard-apple-tv-2000595407,https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Murderbot_topart.jpg,2025-05-12T13:00:37Z,"On a distant planet in a future where space travel through wormholes is routineand corny soap operas are considered “premium entertainment”surveyors make a discovery that would surely be deadly, if n… [+5287 chars]","On a distant planet in a future where space travel through wormholes is routineâand corny soap operas are considered “premium entertainment”âsurveyors make a discovery that would surely be deadly, if not for the Security Unit theyâve reluctantly brought with them. Thatâs Murderbot, Apple TV+âs latest sci-fi venture, which layers that premise with many nuances, delights, shocks, and multidimensional characters, including the robot. Especially the robot. Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, who also executive produces, stars as the sentient construct made partially of metal, partially of cloned organic materials. The humans on the survey team are initially unaware it’s secretly named itself “Murderbot,” so they call it “SecUnit.” They’re also initially unaware that SecUnit is curious enough to have hacked its own “governor module,” the part of its programming that makes it have to obey all human commands, and is therefore completely rogue. However, Murderbot still takes direction, albeit while grumbling in sarcastic voice-overs about how very weird humans are. It would much rather spend its time binging the thousands of hours of media it’s downloadedâthe viewer is treated to frequent glimpses of its favorite show, the hilariously lurid Star Trek riff The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moonâthan doing its actual job. But it has realized, much to its surprise, that these particular humans are actually… not terrible.

 As Murderbot shows us in a way that gently pokes fun (but is never mean-spirited), hippies find a way to persist even in an era where much of existence is beholden to the cold, greedy laws of “the Company.” Somehow, they’re a beacon of feel-good vibes in a system that gets by on cynicism and cruelty. Though the group hails from Preservation Alliance, a rare independent planet, they still must comply with the all-powerful corporation that won’t permit their survey mission unless they rent the required equipment. Since they’re on a budget, they go for the most cost-efficient choices, including a recently refurbished older-model SecUnit. To Murderbot’s surprise, these “idiots” consider it to be a person, an actual member of the team. That belief is further justified once they see its rather human-looking face, and realize there’s something resembling a personality lurking beneath all that awkwardness and disdain. As SecUnit gets to know them, and steps up to protect them again and again, Murderbot finds a way into exploring larger questions about the differences between humans and machines, and the idea that self-awareness can have quite the learning curve no matter what material you’re made from. Â© Apple TV+ Murderbot‘s casting is impeccable, so all praise to creators, writers, directors, and executive producers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz and their team for assembling this group; along with SkarsgÃ¥rd, it’s headed up by Noma Dumezweni as even-tempered (but prone to panic attacks) team leader Dr. Mensah and David Dastmalchian as augmented human Dr. Gurathin, who’s distrustful of Murderbot from the start. The rest of the crew includes Sabrina Wu, Akshay Khanna, Tattiawna Jones, and Tamara Podemski, whose characters have palpably close relationships even before the mission begins.

 Murderbot is based on Martha Wells’ Hugo- and Nebula-winning Murderbot Diaries book series, but it specifically hews to the plot of All Systems Red, the 2017 novella that introduced Murderbot to the world. The adaptation is quite faithful though there are some understandable changes. The show obviously leans on voice-over to let the audience in on Murderbot’s ongoing internal dialogue (his disgusted reactions help propel the series’ wry sense of humor). A few characters are missing. And a few plot points are altered in ways that make the show’s central mystery more visually dynamic. Oh yeah, that’s right: Murderbot is also a mystery. Very soon after they arrive, the team realizes all is not what it seems on that distant planet. The pieces come together in a suspenseful yet fast-paced wayâmost episodes hover around 25 minutes and end on cliffhangersâas Murderbot and the humans become determined to outwit a murky yet obviously powerful threat.

 No plot spoilers here, but it’s entirely worth pointing out that while the sci-fi thrills are a lot of fun, Murderbot‘s true pleasures come from its characters. Dumezweni is wonderful as the kind-hearted boss who treats everyone like family, but can and will step up to kick ass when needed; Dastmalchian has his best role since Late Night With the Devil, this time as a man who’s overcome hell to find a safe place on Mensah’s team, and isn’t about to let a heavily armed and probably untrustworthy robot jeopardize that. Â© Apple TV+ Best of all, though, is SkarsgÃ¥rd. He makes Murderbot both physically imposing and completely nerdy, balancing thoughtful internal monologues with deadpan reactions and swift, violent action. Murderbot’s Sanctuary Moon addiction may be a source of comedy, but the show and the performer also tap into it very cleverly, showing how absorbing trashy TV has actually taught it a great deal of emotional maturityânot to mention providing crack solutions to real-world problems.

 Murderbot‘s first two episodes arrive May 16 on Apple TV+, followed by a weekly rollout.  Want more io9 news?

Majin Bu, who has a mixed history with leaks, wrote last week that unnamed sources had said iPhones with USB-C will offer “a Stage Manager like interface” when connected to an external display. It wouldn’t be quite a full desktop experience, but would “allow users to extend their screen space, great for presentations, editing, or enhanced viewing.” They added that there “may be some limitations possibly in resolution or the number of apps displayed at once.” Given Bu’s history, it’s hard to put too much stock in that all on its own.Then again, in a new episode of the 9to5Mac’s video series iOS Decoded, Jeff Benjamin says that he’s seen Stage Manager working with an iPhone and, tantalizingly, it had “full-on external display support.” In an article accompanying the video, he writes that 9to5Mac has been able to test the feature using the iOS Xcode Simulator. He doesn’t think it’s likely Apple will roll that out to iPhones in the real world, but it’s notable that Apple has been interested enough in the idea to test it out.Apple wouldn’t be the first to try this — there were attempts that predated even Samsung’s DeX — but it’s an intriguing idea all the same. iPhones already have limited external display support, using cables or wirelessly through AirPlay, but that support is generally limited to either screen mirroring or on a per-app basis — like casting a YouTube video to an AirPlay-enabled TV.",The Verge

In addition, for China, there was an additional 125 percent tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. For us, that’s some of our US AppleCare and accessories business, and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145 percent.Also, for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April, as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and downstream products that contain semiconductors. For the June quarter, as I talked about in my opening comments, we estimate the impact — assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter — to be $900 million to our costs. I wouldn’t want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter.",The Verge

Bloomberg reported in March that the 2025 iPhone Air was originally supposed to come with a 6.9-inch screen, but Apple reduced its size to 6.6 inches to avoid another bendgate scenario.Kuo’s list also indicates Apple is already working on its second foldable device for release in 2027.The rumor aligns with a report from The Information over the weekend saying Apple may begin to stagger releasing new iPhones. That would see high-end versions of the iPhone 18 – including the Pro, Air, and a rumored foldable iPhone – introduced in the fall, before the cheaper standard model and budget “e” version launch in the spring of 2027.",The Verge

The new capability, which PayPal announced earlier this month, is a result of the EU forcing Apple to open iPhone NFC chips up for third-party contactless payments under the Digital Markets Act. PayPal’s contactless wallet works with terminals that support Mastercard payments and is iPhone-only for now, so it won’t work on an Apple Watch, iPhone Ticker reports (via a machine translation). In December, a Norwegian payment app called Vipps became the first to take advantage of Apple’s changing ecosystem, nearly a year after Apple first announced it was opening up its NFC hardware to third-party wallet apps for EU users last year. Apple hasn’t only opened iPhone tap-to-pay to the EU. It announced in August that it would let developers offer in-app NFC-based payments in the US and other regions, too. The company also allows businesses to use iPhone NFC readers to accept contactless payments in third-party apps, which is a capability PayPal started offering in Venmo and PayPal Zettle in March last year.",The Verge

It adds that an attacker could also show images on something like a smart speaker’s display — as demonstrated with an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker in the video below — or tap into the speaker’s microphone to listen to nearby conversations.Apple has already patched the bugs, but there are still risks via non-Apple-made AirPlay devices. And while there’s a relatively low chance of a hacker being on your home network, Wired points out that AirBorne attacks could also happen if you connect to a public network with an device that uses AirPlay — like a MacBook or an iPhone — that isn’t updated with the latest Apple software.The risks extend to CarPlay devices, too. Oligo found that attackers “could execute an RCE attack” via CarPlay under certain conditions, like connecting to a car’s Wi-Fi hotspot that’s still using a “default, predictable or known wifi hotspot password.” Once they’re in, hackers could do things like show images on the car’s infotainment system or track the car’s location, according to Oligo.As Oligo points out, there are tens of millions of third-party AirPlay devices, including things like standalone speakers, home theater systems, TVs. The firm also notes that CarPlay “is widely-used and available in over 800 vehicle models.” According to Wired, Apple created patches for affected third-party devices” as well, but a cybersecurity expert tells the outlet that Apple doesn’t directly control the patching process of third-party devices.

Given the pair’s emphasis on building a hardware device for the AI era, and Ive’s pedigree at Apple, it’s likely a consumer-facing product.Io launched last spring as part of a joint project between OpenAI and Ive’s design firm LoveFrom. In the fourth quarter of last year, Io and OpenAI entered into an official agreement for OpenAI to receive a 23 percent stake in Io. Now OpenAI is buying the entity outright.The merger is a slightly complicated one. The Io team was made up of 55 people prior to this announcement. Now it will expand to include both Io and OpenAI employees—hardware and software engineers, physicists, scientists, and “experts in product development and manufacturing,” according to a blog post on OpenAI’s website. Ive and Lovefrom will manage the creative design process. But Ive will remain independent, OpenAI says, and his firm LoveFrom will continue to operate as a separate entity. The Io team will instead report to Peter Welinder, OpenAI’s vice president of product, who has worked at OpenAI for eight and a half years.Io’s founding team has major design chops. Beyond Ive, the founders include Evans Hankey and Tang Tan, who both worked at Apple. Those who've worked closely with them say they're known to hire people whom they believe have exceptional taste.By bringing on Ive, OpenAI is officially embarking on what is likely one of the most ambitious AI hardware project to date. A number of other major tech companies, including Meta and Google, have tried developing AI-powered devices such as smart glasses in recent years, but mainstream adoption of the technology has been slow and some devices have been plagued by glitches.Humane, another high-profile AI hardware startup founded by former Apple employees, debuted a wearable device in late 2023. Reviewers later found the device, a pin, was susceptible to overheating and a number of other issues. Less than two years later Humane’s devices were pulled from the market, and its operating system software and patents were sold to printer giant HP.The joint effort between Altman and Ive was spurred by advancements in AI and computing power. In its blog post, OpenAI wrote that “computers are now seeing, thinking and understanding.” Altman wrote on X that he was “excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.”Altman reportedly has hardware ambitions beyond the generative AI software his company develops and sells, and Ive has seemingly been eager to make new imprints in the design world since he left Apple in 2019. “I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the past 30 years has led me to this moment,” Ive said in the video. “While I am both anxious and excited about the responsibility of the substantial work ahead, I am so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of such an important collaboration.”",Wired

Powerful iPad
The 11th-generation iPad has been introduced in March 2025 and it is a major leap in Apple’s affordable tablet line. Powering it is the A16 Bionic chip, it gives this iPad a huge performance and efficiency boost compared to the last generation. The A16 features a 5-core CPU, a 4-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine, more than enough to handle intensive apps, multitasking and creative workflows. Paired with 6GB of RAM (and 128GB storage), the iPad 11 delivers a smooth user experience whether youâre streaming or gaming.
The screen is a standout in itself, and this is why iPads are so popular: an 11-inch Liquid Retina display with a 2360 x 1640 pixel resolution at 264 ppi with sharp images, deep color and excellent viewing angles. True Tone technology adjusts the color temperature of the display to your environment and 500 nits of brightness make the screen readable and clear even in direct sunlight.



For video calling or photography users, the iPad 11 has a 12MP rear camera with autofocus, Smart HDR 4, and 4K video recording and a 12MP front camera with Center Stage to keep you constantly in frame in video calls. Both cameras come with advanced features like cinematic video stabilization and extended dynamic range. You can use this iPad as a productivity and business tool super easily. With up to all-day battery life, you can count on the iPad 11 to get you through work or a vacation.
Appleâs reputation for rarely discounting its devices is true, and this Amazon deal is as one of the best opportunities to get the latest iPad at a reduced price.

Sci-fi fans like what they like, including the show’s main character, played by Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd: a Security Unit that’s hacked its own system, gained free will, and discovered the wild world of trashy TV. Its favorite show is The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a soapy space opera that most of the other characters disdain but Murderbot considers to be “premium entertainment.” And it would know: by the time we meet it on Murderbot, it’s consumed thousands of hours of entertainment programming. It enjoys the show, but Sanctuary Moon proves to be surprisingly influential, too, giving SecUnit much-needed inspiration when it needs it the most. Â© Apple TV+ “We loved the books. We wanted to treat this as if the character really existed,” Paul Weitz told io9 at a recent Murderbot press day. “So because Murderbot is so obsessed with it, [Sanctuary Moon and the other media was] something that we could do in the show that was true, we felt. And every step of the way, we were checking in with Martha Wells, showing her visuals, sending her scripts. So we knew that she was going to get a kick out of it as well. But we wanted to see what Murderbot was into.”

 He continued. “Also, we love the idea that other people are disrespectful of what Murderbot is into, but that it sticks to its guns through the end. It’s having this big adventure. It’s having to sort of be in an action sci-fi show, but it does just want to watch [Sanctuary Moon]. So we thought it was really important to check in with it.” As for creating The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon as a show within the show, the team aimed to do the exact opposite of Murderbot itself: it’s bright, it’s corny, and it’s full of familiar faces giving deliberately over-the-top performances. “In terms of the texture of the show itself, we would put every kind of maximalist instinct that we had, which wasn’t appropriate for Murderbot, into Sanctuary Moon,” Chris Weitz said. “So the colors are amped up. It’s shot on a virtual stage as opposed to in actual locations, which was the rule for the on-planet scenes in Murderbot. We were also dialing up friends of ours, especially ones who had experience in big franchises, because there’s something about fandom as well that we were sort of playing on.”

 John Cho on Murderbot‘s show within a show. Â© Apple TV+ “So John [Cho] being in Star Trek and Clark Gregg from the MCU and DeWanda [Wise] having been in the Jurassic World franchise, as well as the weird kind of meta friendship of Jack McBrayer and [Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd]âit’s a real friendship. It’s just there’s a kind of a meta aspect to it. So it was a fun repository for all of those strange notions.” Murderbot‘s first two episodes arrive May 16 on Apple TV+.  Want more io9 news?

However, despite how ubiquitous they’ve become, they’re still nowhere near as discrete — or long-lasting — as a smart ring like the Samsung Galaxy Ring. Thankfully, if you’re looking to ditch the watch, Samsung’s first-gen smart ring is available with a $100 gift card at Best Buy and Amazon, where you can pick it up in a variety of sizes starting at $299.99 ($100 off), an all-time low.In many ways, the Android-only Galaxy Ring is more of an accessory for existing Samsung users than it is a standalone device. It’s not as a capable as the Oura Ring 4, our No. 1 pick for the best smart ring, though it does showcase excellent hardware and comes in wide ranges of sizes, from 5 to 15. Plus, unlike the Oura, the Galaxy Ring provides standard activity and sleep tracking without requiring you to pay a monthly fee. That’s a boon for anyone with subscription fatigue.In terms of basics, Samsung’s IP68 water-resistant ring can measure your blood oxygen level, skin temperature, heart rate, and track your steps and workouts. That being said, you’ll need a Galaxy phone to leverage all of Samsung’s ecosystem-centric tricks, including the ability to access insights about your quality of sleep and Samsung’s Energy Score feature, which attempts to quantify your fatigue levels. If you own a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra, you’ll even get several additional days of battery life, thanks in part to the way Samsung’s Health app prioritizes which device’s sensors to pull from.All that is to say that the Galaxy Ring remains best suited for existing Samsung users, rather than those tapped into other ecosystems.

Field would lead the charge on developing “the next-gen Blue Oval Intelligence tech stack to deliver smart, connected vehicles, and services that improve over time through constant updates,” it said in the release. Now, as Ford grapples with stagnant EV sales and project delays, Field is wrestling with the challenge of how to enact that bold vision of the future, given the harsh realities of the present. At the time of his hire, the only car company with a snappy, seamless, and satisfying software experience was Tesla. Legacy automakers like Ford could only look on with envy as Elon Musk’s company pushed out monthly over-the-air updates that amazed and delighted his many customers.Ford wanted that too, and so it hired Field to lead the effort. In addition to heading Apple’s secretive car project, Field also served as chief engineer at Tesla overseeing the Model 3’s design. Who better to turn this lumbering 121-year-old company into a cutting-edge software shop?Who better to turn this lumbering 121-year-old company into a cutting-edge software shop?Four years later, there have been some notable successes — and some equally notable setbacks. Ford has rolled out a number of new features, including its popular and highly rated BlueCruise hands-free driver assist system. The Ford Digital Experience is the new Android-powered infotainment system that enhances rather than blocks smartphone mirroring. And the automaker launched a Silicon Valley-based skunkworks project to design its next-gen EV. But while its rivals roll out high-performing, affordable electric models, Ford’s sales have slowed significantly. The Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning have seen year-over-year sales drops. And last month, Reuters scooped that the automaker was scrapping its high-cost next-generation electrical architecture, also known as FNV4 (for fully networked vehicle). The platform was costly, contributing to a $5 billion loss on EVs and software in 2024, but also a key effort to update and improve Ford’s software experience, the publication said.The decision didn’t come lightly, Field says in a rare interview. “Stopping any engineering project for a leader like me is always hard,” he says. “You put a lot of time and effort into these things. But the world in which we started this project is not the world we live in today.”‘A more incremental approach’The world that Ford lives in today is one where ICE and hybrid vehicles are selling at higher rates than the company’s electric options. It’s also one in which President Trump’s trade war is expected to jack up the costs for key automotive parts, including EV batteries. That leaves Field with the challenge of developing software not only for the company’s EVs, which are essentially rolling computers, but also its gas-guzzling, 12V-battery powered internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Field says it was more cost-effective to adapt Ford’s third-generation architecture — FNV3, now rebranded as FNV3.X — to the full range of the lineup, rather than build a new platform with a more limited application. “By taking a more incremental approach, we’ve vastly expanded the number of vehicles in our portfolio that are going to get the latest infotainment systems and BlueCruise,” Field says. “That wasn’t in the plan before with FNV4, because it really required a lot of change to a vehicle to incorporate it.” Still, you can imagine why Ford was interested in pursuing the project to begin with. FNV4 was going to be the company’s first crack at a zonal architecture, the type of which has become increasingly popular among EV manufacturers. A zonal architecture means fewer electronic control units (ECUs), less wiring, and most importantly, less production cost. Tesla pioneered the use, and it has since been adapted by several EV-only shops, including Rivian and Scout. “Stopping any engineering project for a leader like me is always hard.”Instead, Ford will stick with a domain-based architecture, which Field admits is “not as elegant,” but allows his team to develop software for a broader range of vehicles. In a domain, or features-based architecture, a car may have dozens of ECUs to control everything from power windows to the HVAC system to the infotainment platform. In Field’s thinking, a handful of primary ECUs embedded with the most important software code send out commands to the rest of the vehicle’s microprocessors. The software does the heavy lifting, making the exact number of control units open to interpretation. After all, microprocessors are relatively cheap. And that way the company’s engineers can design a system that’s compatible with EVs like the Mustang Mach-E, all the way up to more complex ICE vehicles, like an F-150 Super Duty with uplifter modules to raise and lower snow plows. “I would care less about the number of microprocessors in my vehicle,” Field says. “If I have 50 of them and four really share in all of the major operations that we want to do for the customer, and a lot of the others have very little software and perform much more of a service function to those big ones, I’m kind of getting towards the whole point of the project.” Field doesn’t have the luxury of developing software for a handful of cars that were built from the ground-up to be computers. He has to wrangle a vast, complex software network that integrates codes from a variety of suppliers that Ford has worked with for decades. And in navigating those relationships, Field may have to step on a few toes, because “those companies do not want to become contract electronics manufacturers. They want to sell full systems.” He understands this concern, but his approach will necessitate centralizing and consolidating some of these modules under Ford’s control in order to ensure everything works harmoniously. The key is the software, Field says. Get that centralized and under your control, and then simplify the interfaces. Figuring that out is more important than eliminating or replacing every microprocessor in the vehicle, sort of like how the brain sends out signals to the rest of the body. “I would care less about the number of microprocessors in my vehicle.”“When you’re drawing something on a piece of paper, there’s a very complicated loop between your brain and your hand. And it’s slow, but it’s very adept,” Field says. “If you touch your hand to a stove, it’s not doing a round trip through your brain. It’s going straight through the lizard brain and creating a reaction. There’s parts of the car that need to work that way.”Field wants to replicate that instantaneous process for critical functions, like automatic emergency braking, traction control, or airbag deployment. Other functions, like pinch protection for windows, can be centralized into a module that Ford controls.“We’ve already selected what parts of vehicle functionality that currently exist in modules we’d want to start bringing into central compute,” he added. “We’ve called it a super zonal, central compute with a super zonal. So, it’s like one zone.” Ford’s hands-free BlueCruise system in a Mustang Mach-E. Image: FordThe idea of a “software-defined vehicle” has quickly become a buzzy way to describe the auto industry’s slow-motion shift to vehicles with cellular connections that can accept over-the-air (OTA) updates to introduce new features or fix bugs in the software. The idea makes sense when you’re talking about an EV, which is essentially an always-on computer with a huge battery that sits in your driveway and waits for the latest update. But as Ford’s EV sales slowed down, the company was forced to pivot to take into consideration its millions of ICE and hybrid vehicles too.While the skunkworks team develops the next-generation vehicle that’s so crucial to Ford’s future, Field was left with the task of figuring out how to design a software delivery system for giant gas-powered trucks and commercial vans. “We can’t leave those products stranded from a digital and software perspective and just focus on EVs,” he says. A lot of that work focuses on energy management. An EV with an 81kWh battery can passively receive a big software update without losing much energy. But that same update could drain the 12V battery in a gas-powered Ford Bronco without proper oversight. “We have ways that we can do partial updates,” Field says. “We will do large scale downloads while the vehicle is in operation. We will monitor the battery and know when to start an OTA or when not to start an OTA.”Being able to push software updates to tens of thousands of vehicles, regardless of powertrain, is ultimately why Ford decided to kill FNV4, which Field says was risky, but still the right move. The automaker’s sales team is happy, as are Ford’s integrated services team and its thousands of dealers. The road ahead will still be a hard one, with EV sales stalling out and a mercurial and EV-hostile administration in the White House — but Field thinks Ford can get there. And after all, what difference does it make to the customer which type of architecture they get? “Zonal architecture is for engineers and industry analysts and other things,” he says. “It’s kind of irrelevant to the customer.”What is relevant to the customer is an amazing software experience in a car they love, not necessarily the overall package in which it is delivered, he concludes. “Software is supposed to be soft,” Field says, “and the industry has made it hard and made it match up to the physical boxes. So to me, like the biggest thing is, are you making your software soft, putting it where you need it to be, and not being at the whim of the legacy of where all the software sits?”",The Verge

On the surface, the Apple TV Plus sci-fi comedy is a somewhat generic futuristic story about a group of humans exploring a dangerous planet with the help of a security bot that’s designed to protect them. The key is the perspective: the story is told from the bot’s point of view, and that bot is really going through it. It’s experiencing free will for the first time and struggling with the ramifications of that, making it anxious, awkward, and addicted to streaming television. It may be built to kill — but it’s just like me.The show opens on Muderbot’s (Alexander Skarsgård) awakening. While seemingly idle and working security at a mining facility, internally it’s actually hacking away at the chip that governs its free will. These bots, called sec units (which is short for security unit) are hybrids, powered by AI and with bodies that are a mix of machine and organic material. But they also have to do whatever they’re told thanks to something called the governor module. Somehow Murderbot manages to disable this and then — well, he’s free, but only kind of. It’s illegal to have a sec unit without a working module, punishable by an acid bath, and so Murderbot is forced to pretend it’s still intact so as to not die and lose its newfound freedom.Eventually, the bot is picked up by a group surveying an alien planet who need a sec unit for insurance purposes. They pick the cheapest model (at this point, Murderbot is a refurbished unit, far from top of the line). However, they also come from a part of the galaxy that is morally against the idea of sec units, viewing these machines as a form of slave labor, which creates an interesting dynamic. While Murderbot is trying to hide all of the elements that show it’s a sentient being with thoughts and feelings and interests, the crew around him slowly start treating it more like an actual human being.While all of this plays out, Murderbot serves as a narrator, which is important; since it’s trying to keep its true self hidden, the only way to really know what’s really going on is to hear it from the bot itself. Skarsgård’s somewhat stilted delivery fits the bot perfectly. It sounds like someone who is trying to sound human. It’s a little awkward and clunky, which is what makes it so fitting.What really makes it work, though, is just how funny and relatable Murderbot is. It hates humans — one of the first things it says is that people are “assholes” — and is terrified of basically every social interaction. At one point, Murderbot weighs the pros and cons of getting an acid bath versus making a speech in front of the rest of the crew, and later it’s forced into the most devastating of all situations: prolonged eye contact. It’s also constantly trying to avoid its responsibilities so that it can watch all of the streaming shows it’s downloaded, and uses its surveillance powers to follow all of the various romantic entanglements happening at the camp. In fact, much of its behavior is derived from soap operas, where it quotes lines in moments of drama because it’s not sure what else to say. Skarsgård’s dry delivery of these quips is the highlight of the show.As you’d expect, the charade doesn’t last forever, and eventually the two sides grow into each other. Murderbot becomes more and more comfortable being an autonomous, thinking being, while the research crew slowly starts to understand what Murderbot actually is, and begin treating it like, well, another member of the group (even if some of them remain suspicious).It’s not an especially deep exploration of the concept of free will, but rather a sort of strange and awkward coming-of-age story. Murderbot may be a hulking killing machine, but its arc towards becoming an actual person is both hilarious and relatable, filled with awkward social interactions and important self revelations that feel more high school drama than space opera. It’s heartwarming watching it not only grow into itself, but find the right people to allow for that growth.And it does it all while doing a decent job at being a security unit, fighting off Dune-style sandworms and other malfunctioning bots. These sci-fi elements would be drab and forgettable on their own, but they become hilarious when viewed from Murderbot’s perspective.Murderbot also fills in a hole in Apple’s growing library of science fiction. While it has century-spanning epics and near-future nightmares and grim dystopias, it’s all pretty serious stuff. There aren’t a lot of laughs. And while Murderbot explores some important issues surrounding artificial intelligence and free will, it does so with a sense of playfulness and charm, and just the right amount of awkwardness.",The Verge

But Cue calls AI a “huge technological shift,” and suggests that such shifts can humble companies that once seemed unassailable. “When I got to Silicon Valley,” he said, “all the best companies or the most successful companies” — he mentioned HP, Sun Microsystems, and Intel — “either don’t exist today or are significantly smaller and much less impactful.” Some companies have already tried — and so far, failed — to replace smartphones with AI gadgets. Those early attempts haven’t worked out yet, but they’ve tried to put users in touch with an AI assistant that’s divorced from smartphones, like Meta AI in the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Apple is rumored to be working on its own similar solutions that would see users interacting with AI through auxiliary devices like smartwatches, future AirPods, and yes, smart glasses.",The Verge

On Friday, Trump threatened Apple with 25% tariffs on any iPhones that aren’t made in the U.S. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” In addition, Trump slammed the European Union as “formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the [U.S.] on TRADE” and threatened them with 50% tariffs beginning June 1 because, apparently, they’ve been “very difficult to deal with.” Following Trump’s posts, Apple shares fell 4%.

 Since taking office, Trump’s admiration of protectionism and Gilded Age tariffs has influenced his evolving and often contradictory tariff policies. Throughout it all, China, where Apple produces about 90% of all iPhones, has been public enemy No. 1. Last month, Apple’s stock lost over $300 billion in one day after Trump slapped tariffs several countries including China, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam, which are some of Apple’s major manufacturing hubs. Analysts at investment bank UBS warned that the reciprocal tariffs on imported goods could drastically jack up iPhone prices.Â Although the administration introduced exemptions for electronics like phones and computers, Cook said on a quarterly earnings call that existing tariffs could cost Apple $900 million this quarter. To reduce impact, Apple planned to shift U.S.-bound iPhone production to India by the end of next year. That didn’t sit well with Trump. Last week in Qatar, he said, “I had a little problem with Tim Cook. I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good… But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”

 Indeed, Cook spent years cozying up to Trump, who actually mentioned forcing Apple to manufacture in the U.S. all the way back in 2016 during his first presidential campaign. In January, Cook donated $1 million of his own money to Trump’s inauguration fund. Their relationship has earned Apple some favors. Per the Washington Post, the first Trump administration was considering a policy that would impose a 10% tariff on all imports from China. Cook personally appealed to Trump and, shortly later, the administration scaled back its plan and and awarded exceptions to some electronics, including iPhones. But he who plays with fire will eventually get burned. Trump’s demands on Apple represent a significant obstacle for the company. Per the Guardian, Dan Ives, an analyst at financial firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors, “The reality is that it would take three years and $30bn in our estimation to move even 10% of [Apple’s] supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruptions in the process.”

 Last month, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called Trump’s trade war the “worst self-inflicted wound” by any administration. But during a recent Fox News appearance,Â current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “The president is trying to bring back precision manufacturing to the U.S. I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities is this external production, especially in semiconductors, and Apple’s components are semiconductors.” However, when asked what is realistic for Apple to actually comply to given that moving manufacturing takes time, Bessent replied, “I don’t know from company to company, so we’ll have to see.”",Gizmodo.com

The AirPods 4 come in two versions: the standard model without Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and the more expensive ANC version. The standard AirPods 4 are now priced at just $99, down from their usual $129, while the AirPods 4 with ANC have dropped to $148 from $179. Both are the lowest prices ever available for these earbuds, so this is an offer not to be missed if you’re an Apple fan.

Which AirPods 4 Should You Buy?
Both models are powered by Apple’s new H2 chip which delivers an incredible audio performance. The chip improves sound quality, reduces latency, and fuels smarter features like Personalized Spatial Audio which adjusts sound according to the movement of your head. The open-ear fit of the earbuds is comfortable and sits lightly on the ear without intrusive silicone tips (four sizes are included). Despite this open design, the audio quality is impressively balanced with rich mids, clean highs, and well-controlled bass, offering a natural listening experience.
The standard AirPods 4 (which now cost $99) include sweat and water resistance and they are robust for exercise and outdoor use. They offer up to 30 hours of total battery life using the USB-C charging case. The earbuds also simplify setup and seamlessly switch between Apple devices with optimized connectivity through the H2 chip. Voice calls are improved by advanced audio processing that keeps your voice isolated and clear even in noisy spaces.



If a user wants more sound isolation, AirPods 4 with ANC (at $148) provides a huge upgrade: Their Active Noise Cancellation effectively eliminates ambient noise, so that you can focus on your music or calls without needing to crank up the volume too much. Transparency Mode allows you to stay aware of your surroundings when needed, striking a perfect balance between immersion and safety. This model also features a wireless charging case that is Apple Watch charger compatible and Qi-certified pads, making the premium experience even more convenient.
Of course, AirPods 4 with ANC don’t provide the same kind of deep noise cancellation as in-ear ANC earbuds such as the AirPods Pro 2, but they’re a great option for users who are sensitive to earbud intrusion but desire good noise cancellation.

Now that they’re back to just $169, the AirPods 2 are the best upgrade you can make to bring your favorite content with you anywhere, along with crystal-clear calls and outstanding noise cancellation for when you just want to be alone with your thoughts or your tunes. Apple’s H2 processor chip, their latest and most powerful, is at the heart of the AirPods Pro 2 and gives them better sound quality and features than any of the previous iterations of the AirPods.

Best Sound Yet
Apple loaded the latest version of the AirPods Pro with significant upgrades across the board, starting of course with the sound. The H2 chip powers an improved low-distortion driver that covers the entire range of sound from sharp highs to booming bass. When you encounter music that’s optimized for spatial audio, the AirPods Pro 2 are ready and waiting with a personalized delivery that suits your unique ear shape and moves with your head. All in all, it’s the most immersive and true-to-life sound yet from any Apple earbuds.
When you’re switching from your music or podcast to a call on your iPhone, the Voice Isolation technology of the AirPods Pro 2 kicks in, letting your voice come through clear and crisp even when you’re in a noisy environment. That music-to-phone toggling and all of the other controls you need are also upgraded in the AirPods Pro 2, with simple swipe, press, and hold motions to manage playback. Most impressively, Siri can detect when you nod yes or shake your head no when it asks if you want to hear a message, answer a call, or manage a notification from your iPhone or iPad.

Background Noise Banished
The biggest tech leap taken by the AirPods Pro 2 is the Active Noise Cancellation, which now eliminates up to 2 times more background noise than the first AirPods Pro, and even more than the AirPods 4. Transparency mode lets in just enough of the outside world to keep you safe, and Conversation Awareness automatically lowers your volume when you’re speaking with someone nearby.
Throw in the next-generation active hearing protection and the world’s first scientifically validated hearing test from any earbuds, and your wireless earbud upgrade choice becomes obvious. The 32% off Amazon deal that brings you the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169 is running right now, so get the last piece of your outdoor gear squared away for $80 off the regular price.

Beats buds for the best bass and bumping in your ears
These are the upgraded version of the original Studio Buds, and theyâve become a fan favorite over time thanks to their sound quality and compatibility across both Apple and Android devices. They also feel super comfortable to wear, too.
The sound profile here is nicely balanced with punchy bass, clear vocals, and enough detail to make your playlists feel fresh. They also have active noise cancellation to block out distractions when you need to focus, and a transparency mode when you want to stay aware of your surroundings. Switching between the two is quick and easy.



There’s more than enough battery to go around to keep you listening for a while, too. You get up to 9 hours of listening time on the buds alone, and the included case brings the total up to 36 hours. A quick 5-minute charge gives you around an hour of playtime, which definitely comes in handy when youâre running out the door. Or you forgot to charge your earbuds, which is pretty common for us. Beyond all that, theyâre rated IPX4, too, so sweat and light rain wonât be a problem. Good thing, because you’ll definitely want to wear these to the gym.
You can get these buds for just $100 (-41%), which is a fantastic price for everything that you get here. From getting to choose the color you want for this price to the absolutely fantastic sound quality, this is a deal you won’t want to pass up. Be sure you grab a pair while you can.

For children, a cellular Apple Watch can be a stepping stone towards an iPhone, and Apple has now marketed that idea in a series of new ads.
On its YouTube channel in Canada, Apple has shared three short videos advertising the benefits of the Apple Watch For Your Kids feature. In each video, a child uses their cellular Apple Watch to text their parents. And in one of the videos, a parent reminds their child who is secretly at a shopping mall that they can see their child's location.

""Apple Watch with cellular lets your kids text, call and location share, all without their own phone,"" says each video's description.


Apple Watch For Your Kids requires a child to have an Apple Watch Series 4 or newer with watchOS 7 and later, while the parent must have an iPhone XS or later. A cellular Apple Watch is recommended for full functionality, but a limited set of features are available on Apple Watch models with Wi-Fi only.

Called “Private Processing,” the feature is totally optional, launches in the “coming weeks,” and neither Meta, WhatsApp, nor third-party companies will be able to see interactions that use it, according to the release.Meta says users can “direct AI to process their requests,” like for AI chat summaries, using Private Processing. If they do, the system won’t “retain access to user messages once the session is complete” so that a potential attacker can’t access them after the fact, according to the company. Meta wants to prevent attackers from targeting users without first compromising the whole system. It also wants to ensure that independent third parties are “able to audit the behavior of Private Processing to independently verify our privacy and security guarantees.” Private Processing is now part of Meta’s bug bounty program, and the company promises to release a “detailed security engineering design paper” as it gets closer to launching the system. The system Meta describes sounds similar to Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC). Like Apple, Meta says it will relay Private Processing requests through a third-party provider for OHTTP, a protocol that obscures users’ IP addresses. But as Wired notes, one difference is that all of WhatsApp’s AI requests are handled on Meta’s servers and users have to initiate Private Processing. On the other hand, Apple defaults to on-device AI processing, but defaults to PCC when requests go to its servers.",The Verge

But Donald Trump’s tariff nonsense pushed me to make a decision: buy a new phone or fix the old one now, before the prices go up. The answer was clearer than ever — I replaced the battery. I have an iPhone 12 Mini, a size Apple no longer makes. It’s small and light, which is what I want from a phone. When it came out, our reviewer found that the battery died on him every evening. I use my phone less than most, and so this was not actually a problem for me — until this year. My battery had degraded to 80 percent of its original capacity, which meant that my phone did actually run out of battery at the end of the day unless I switched on “low power mode” early.Apple has designed its iPhones to be disposable, largely because Jony Ive is an asshole obsessed with “sleekness,” a concept I do not find impressive. Its phones’ actual functions haven’t kept up with the constant churn of iPhone models. For a while now, each major iPhone review has had the theme of “a set of very nice but ultimately minor changes” from the previous model. The changes haven’t been to the phone part of the phone — it’s usually the camera, or the “dynamic island” or USB-C charging. I don’t see any good reason my phone should be disposableI use my phone differently than most people. Mainly, I use it less. My screentime is usually under two hours a day. I do not give a shit about any of the extras — or, for that matter, Apple Intelligence, Image Playground, or the various other toys my phone is too old to support, by design. What I need in a phone is: (1) a phone, for calls; (2) iMessage; (3) navigation: Google Maps and more specialized stuff; and (4) tunes. Just about everything else is optional. The camera could be a potato for all I care.Unlike the jumbo phones I see everywhere, the Mini is sized so that I can actually hold it in my hand and — since I don’t usually carry a purse — fit it in the regrettably inferior pockets of a pair of women’s pants. When I’m backpacking, a small phone is less weight, and while I’m not an ultralight girlie, less weight does mean being less tired at the end of the day. If I’m counting ounces everywhere else, I’m counting them on my phone, too.I don’t see any good reason my phone should be disposable. Sure, pushing people to buy shit they don’t need is a mainstay of capitalism, and arguably part of the reason Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world. It’s only recently and begrudgingly started to allow independent repair to its devices, and even so it’s thrown up barriers like “parts pairing,” which means that if you swap out some of its components, certain phone functions no longer work. But it hasn’t offered me anything to make buying a new phone for $599 (at the low end) a better proposition than repairing it for $90. If anything, deliberately stymieing repair makes me stubbornly want to do it more.I probably would have continued merrily on with the Mini until it was unusable, except for the fucking tariffs. I don’t know what’s going on anymore except that the future has suddenly become unpredictable. Are there going to be iPhones readily available next year? And if so, how much more will they cost? After seeing Port of Los Angeles executive director Gene Seroka tell Bloomberg News about the steep drop in imports, I knew I needed to make a phone decision sooner rather than later. So I paid about $90 to replace the battery.Saving money where I can seems wiseApple’s approach to repair is contemptible enough on its face, but in the world of Trump tariffs, where the supply chain is all fucked up and goods aren’t coming into the ports, it’s hostile. Tim Cook’s famous supply chain prowess involved the introduction of just-in-time manufacturing, which is efficient but notoriously inflexible. Because there are no spares, interruption at any point in the chain means a shortage — as we all learned during the 2020-2021 era of coronavirus pandemic. So with tariffs, I’m nervous that Apple’s super special repair parts may no longer be regularly available. Making phones difficult to repair in this environment is inexcusable. Cook has been busily kissing President Donald Trump’s ass to try to save Apple’s business, which is heavily reliant on foreign manufacturing. He donated $1 million for Trump’s inauguration and showed face at it, too. And what did all this kowtowing get him? Just public humiliation. You’d think, having lived through the first presidency, he’d have realized that in advance.Sure, the tariffs have dropped from their worst peaks — for now, at least. But the uncertainty remains enough to disrupt trade, and I suspect everything is only going to get more expensive in the near term. Saving money where I can seems wise. And so far, my hoarding tendencies have looked, well, pretty prescient. After Trump announced (and then revoked) tariffs on Colombia, I bulk-bought my favorite Colombian coffee and froze the extra. Since then, the price has gone up by $5 for the 5-pound bags I bought — and could go even higher.I’m sure at some point Apple will force me to upgrade by stopping support for crucial functions of the iPhone Mini, but I’m gambling that’s several years in the future. And there’s one more thing an old phone has going for it. Phones are constantly trying to get you to buy new things — in the App Store, in ads being shown to you online, or by upselling you on iCloud storage.

iPadOS 17.7.8 comes a few days after Apple stopped signing iPadOS 17.7.7, the prior version of iPadOS that was available on older iPads. iPadOS 17.7.7 was preventing some users from being able to log into their apps, and iPadOS 17.7.8 presumably addresses the issue.
According to Apple's release notes, the update includes security fixes.
This update provides important security fixes and is recommended for all users. For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/100100
iPadOS 17.7.8 is available for the sixth-generation ‌iPad‌, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and the second-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌. It can be downloaded by going to the Software Update section in the Settings app on eligible devices.

Now the company is retooling for more frequent access. Open the app, and you see a trio of icons that act as gateways to the expanded functions. Within minutes Chesky and his lieutenants are applauding the cheery, retro style of the icons—a house for traditional rentals, a hotel bell for services, and a Jules Verne-ish hot-air balloon representing activities. “We really thought deeply about the metaphor—what was the right visual to express an experience?” says Connor. Once they decided on the balloon, they drilled into how much fire should belch from the basket. The icons were drawn by a former Apple designer whose name Chesky would not divulge. “He’s a bit of a secret weapon,” he says.A less-secret weapon is Chesky’s collaboration with the iconic, also ex-Apple, industrial designer Jony Ive. Chesky’s north star, it should be said, is Apple. “Steve Jobs, to me, is like Michelangelo or da Vinci,” he says. Despite never meeting Jobs, “I feel like I know him deeply, professionally, in a way that few people ever did, in a way that you only possibly could by starting a tech company as a creative person and going on a rocket ship,” Chesky says. By hiring Ive’s LoveFrom company and working with Jobs’ key collaborator, Chesky gets a taste of the famous Jobs/Ive dynamic. Ive himself doesn’t make that comparison, but he does praise Chesky’s design chops. “There are certain tactical things where I hope that sometimes I'm of use to Brian, just as as a fellow designer,” Ive says. “But the majority of our work has been around ideas and the way we frame problems and understand opportunities.”Another key part of the app is the profile page. “You need trust,” Chesky says—meaning a verifiable identity. Airbnb has been vetting the new vendors, which it calls “service hosts.” For months, Chesky says, an army of background researchers has been scrutinizing the résumés, licenses, and recommendations of chefs, photographers, manicurists, masseuses, hair stylists, makeup artists, personal trainers, and aestheticians who provide spa treatments such as facials and microdermabrasions. They’re all being professionally photographed.Airbnb's new guest profile interface.COURTESY OF AIRBNBFor the next phase—turning Airbnb’s user profiles into a primary internet ID—Connor and her team have engaged in some far-out experimentation. She rattles off a list of technologies they’ve been exploring, including biometrics, holograms, and the reactive inks used to deter counterfeiting on official ID cards. But it’s far from easy to become a private identity utility (hello, Facebook), and even Chesky notes that getting governments to accept an Airbnb credential to verify identity is “a stretch goal.”Now that a whole slew of people will have new reasons to chat with each other and coordinate plans, Airbnb has also enhanced its messaging functions. Fellow travelers who share experiences can form communities, stay in touch, even share videos and photos. “I don’t know if I want to call it a social network, because of the stigma associated with it,” says Ari Balogh, Airbnb’s CTO. So they employ a fuzzier term. “We think of it as a connection platform,” he says. “You’re going to see us build a lot more stuff on top of it, although we’re not an advertising system, thank goodness.” (My own observation is that any for-profit company that can host advertising will, but whatever.)",Wired

‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said over the weekend (via The Verge) that Epic will use its ‌Epic Games‌ Sweden account to submit Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌ in the U.S. Apparently, Sweeney has spoken to Apple about the issue, and based on his wording, it sounds like Apple could allow the plan, but he did not say that he has explicit approval from Apple.

We have conversed with Apple on the topic and will use our Epic Games Sweden account to submit Fortnite to the US App Store. We created this account last year to launch Epic Games Store and Fortnite in the European Union, and Apple required an EU-domiciled account.
After Apple was required to support alternative app marketplaces in the European Union under the Digital Markets Act, ‌Epic Games‌ created an account based in Sweden in order to launch the Epic Games Store. Apple initially shut down Epic Games' EU developer account due to Epic's pattern of untrustworthy behavior, but that didn't last. Apple's statement from when it banned the EU account:

Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ""any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion."" In light of Epic's past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.
‌Epic Games‌ claimed that Apple was violating the Digital Markets Act by not allowing it to create an alternative app marketplace in Europe, and the European Union started questioning Apple. Apple ultimately reinstated the account after ‌Epic Games‌ promised to follow the alternative marketplace rules, and Apple avoided issue with EU regulators.
The outcome of the Apple vs. ‌Epic Games‌ dispute in the U.S. resulted in Apple not having to reinstate the U.S. ‌Epic Games‌ account, and it sounds like Apple still has no plan to do so. Apple could object to ‌Epic Games‌ trying to return Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌ using the Swedish account, but given that Apple is already facing the wrath of the judge overseeing the case, it may not want to attract further attention.
‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney offered a ""peace proposal"" to Apple last week, claiming that if Apple extends its ""Apple-tax-free"" framework worldwide, Epic would return Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌ and drop current and future litigation. So far, Apple has given no sign that it will implement the ‌App Store‌ link and payment changes outside of the United States.
Apple is now required to allow developers to add links and buttons to their apps directing customers to purchase options outside of the ‌App Store‌.
Sweeney said that ‌Epic Games‌ is working ""as hard as possible"" to return Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌, but that he doesn't yet know when it will be ready to launch.",MacRumors

But what distinguishes them in particular today is the massive price discount happening on Amazon: After briefly falling to $229, then $199 earlier this month, the AirPods Pro 2 can now be bought for just $169 which is a huge 32% discount from its original price (and nearly as low as the Black Friday deal).
See at Amazon

Superior Sound, Great ANC
Such price variation is unusual for Apple products, especially for a flagship product which reigns supreme in its league. AirPods Pro 2 feature Apple’s latest H2 chip that powers superior sound and longer battery life but also advanced noise cancellation (ANC) and adaptive audio features. The H2 chip is paired with high-excursion drivers and a high dynamic range amplifier to deliver an immersive and clean soundstage with responsive bass and nuanced highs.
You will also be impressed by AirPods Pro 2 intelligent noise control. The active noise cancellation has been doubled from the previous generation and removes ambient noise so that you can focus on your sound or have quiet in noisy areas. For when you just want to stay connected to your surroundings, Transparency mode simply lets ambient noise in, and Adaptive Audio seamlessly blends both modes for the best experience possible no matter what you’re doing. Conversation Awareness is another brilliant addition which automatically lowers volume when you start talking to someone nearby. Last but not least, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking provides an immersive experience with sound everywhere around you for music, movies, and games.



When you purchase these earbuds, Apple offers four sizes of silicone tips (XS, S, M, L) for a comfortable fit in the majority of ear shapes. The acoustic seal the tips create improves sound and stabilizes the earbuds when exercising or driving. Both the AirPods Pro 2 and their MagSafe case are IP54-rated for water, sweat, and dust resistance and can be used at the gym or on-the-go.
Battery life is still as great as before with up to 6 hours of listening time on the same charge and up to 30 hours in total when using the case. The case is also easily charged via USB-C, MagSafe, Apple Watch chargers or any Qi-certified wireless charging pad.
The current 32% discount is as good as it gets when it comes to Black Friday prices, and considering Apple’s history, deals like these don’t hang around for long. Make sure your get yours on Amazon before it runs out of stock.

The planned move comes against the backdrop of the Trump administration imposing tariffs against China of up to 145%.The tech giant is predicting a $900 million impact to Apple's costs this coming quarter if tariff policies, rates and applications stay as they are right now. ""For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,"" Cook said during Apple's Q1 earnings call on May 1, ""and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods products sold in the US.""It comes as some products such as mobile phones and computers have been exempted from those tariffs for the time being. Apple has long centered its iPhone production in China, making it vulnerable to any trade war between the two countries and spurring speculation that tariffs could mean price increases for the company's biggest-selling product.By moving third-party assembly of US iPhones to India, Apple could avoid the most significant cost pressure of a trade war, though India itself faces new tariffs as well.The company had already begun shipping iPhones made in India, adding to its product reserves, before new tariffs became active.A global perspective on iPhones and tariffsWhile it's unclear how long the trade war with China will continue, Apple's shift is part of a larger strategy that may include more US component manufacturing, says Angelo Zino, a senior vice president at CFRA Research.""Apple must think long term with manufacturing capacity,"" Zino said. ""We think Apple will look to double its India iPhone capacity in the next two to three years to help mitigate future China-US tensions.""That said, Zino expects Apple to keep a large China presence, as 15% of its sales will be in that country and global capacity of iPhone manufacturing will still rely on Chinese manufacturing. Cook confirmed that China will ""continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the US.""While Apple wouldn't shift iPhone production entirely to the US, which would be cost-prohibitive, Zino said, it could potentially ramp up modem and internally designed processors with Taiwan Semiconductor in the US. ""That is clearly where the value of Apple lies for the Trump administration, in our view, rather than assembling its devices,"" Zino said.  Watch this: Should You Buy Now or Wait? Our Experts Weigh In on Tariffs
        09:42  Will Apple's manufacturing shift to India last?Muzammil Hassan, head of patent portfolio management and monetization in India for Quandary Peak Research, noted that Apple's shift to more manufacturing in India was already happening before tariffs were enacted.""I don't think it's a temporary move,"" Hassan said. ""Foxconn has been training thousands of employees in their factories in Tamil Nadu. In fact, there were reports that iPhone 17 might be developed and manufactured exclusively in India.""While shifting all US iPhone production to India may be bold, Hassan said, Apple is not pioneering with its manufacturing strategy. ""I'd say Apple is late to the party. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo and Motorola among others were already manufacturing their phones in India.""In addition, Google may be migrating production of its Pixel phone to India from Vietnam, he said.",CNET

Apple will be hosting free group labs from Tuesday, June 10 through Friday, June 13. During these labs, developers will be able to join Apple engineers online to discuss and ask questions about WWDC 2025 announcements. Developers can register starting today, with available topics ranging from Apple Intelligence to SwiftUI.
Developers will also be able to set up one-on-one appointments with Apple experts online for guidance on various topics, such as app design, privacy, accessibility, and more. Apple says one-on-one lab requests will open immediately after the WWDC 2025 keynote on Monday, June 9 via this page and the Apple Developer app.
Apple has shared helpful tips for both the group and one-on-one labs.
During the week of WWDC, Apple's engineers will answer questions and help to solve technical issues in the Apple Developer Forums.
Apple has also listed various community events that will be held around the world leading up to, during, and shortly after WWDC 2025.

In the first episode of Tick Talk w/ Eric Migicovsky, he gives a brief demo of the Core 2 Duo that’s still in development, talks about potential new features, and addresses concerns over how US tariffs will affect the price and delivery of the new smartwatches.Migicovsky is still confident the Core 2 Duo — the cheaper model with a black-and-white screen lacking touch capabilities — is going to ship some time in July 2025, but his demo of one of the first units from the factory shows a device with software that’s still under development. The familiar PebbleOS UI is there, but basic features like telling time haven’t been enabled yet, and the Core Devices team is still working on drivers for vibrating notifications and the smartwatch’s accelerometer.The Core 2 Duo will come with a silicone strap reminiscent of the Apple Watch’s with a slot for tucking excess length away while it’s worn, and Migicovsky demonstrated the tiny USB-C magnetic charging dongle they revealed last month.Although Migicovsky believes the original Pebble team did a lot of things right a decade ago with the original Pebble watches, there are a few new features he wants to eventually introduce for the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, a follow-up that’s set to ship in December 2025 with a color touchscreen. Watch face widgets would make it easier to see information like the weather or upcoming appointments at a quick glance, while deeper integration with Beeper — the universal chat app Migicovsky developed after selling Pebble to Google — would improve both smartwatches’ communication capabilities.Better access to AI voice agents is something on Core Devices’ wish list, given that the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2 both have speakers and microphones. And thanks to the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) forcing Apple to open up its devices, Migicovsky says he will support expanded operability with iOS should Apple allow it, potentially allowing users to respond by voice to incoming messages when paired to an iPhone, at least in Europe.The Core Devices team is also doing a lot of work on PebbleOS’ underlying architecture and porting it to two new Bluetooth chipsets with the goal of expanding the types of devices the operating system can be used with — not just wearables. But what those other devices might be hasn’t been revealed yet.During the podcast, Migicovsky also addresses the effect President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods will have on the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, as both smartwatches are manufactured in Shenzhen. With steeper tariffs for these types of devices on pause, Chinese-made smartwatches are currently subjected to 27.5 percent tariffs, he says, which will potentially increase the price of incoming shipments by $10 or $25. But specifics on how that will affect the cost of the $149 Core 2 Duo and $225 Core Time 2 aren’t yet known.",The Verge

iOS 19 design conceptGurman previously reported that iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 will have new designs, with added translucency for a more glass-like appearance. In his Power On newsletter this week, he said that the design changes will extend to tvOS 19 for the Apple TV and watchOS 12 for the Apple Watch, but he did not provide any specific details.
The design changes will apparently be inspired by visionOS for Apple's Vision Pro headset, and visionOS 3 is expected to have some design tweaks of its own.
Overall, Gurman said Apple is aiming for a more consistent appearance across its operating systems, especially for the Mac and iPad. He previously reported that iPadOS 19 will make iPads more like Macs, with improved multitasking, productivity, and app window management. In addition, a leaker known as Majin Bu claimed that iPadOS 19 will display a macOS-like menu bar while an iPad is connected to a Magic Keyboard.
Gurman previously revealed that iOS 19's new design is codenamed ""Solarium,"" which is a room with glass walls that allow in sunlight. The codename could hint at the more translucent menus and buttons that are expected across iOS 19 and the other upcoming software updates, which Apple will announce during WWDC 2025. The developer conference is just two weeks away, with the keynote set to be held on Monday, June 9.
Despite the buzz surrounding AI lately, Gurman believes that the redesigned software platforms will be ""the highlight of the show"" at WWDC this year.

In the U.S., the band costs $49.
The matching Pride Harmony watch face features rainbow stripes that dynamically shift to form large hour numerals as users raise their wrist to check the time.
The matching iPhone and iPad wallpaper features colorful stripes that change position as users move, lock, or unlock their devices.
Apple says its Pride Collection celebrates the strength and beauty of LGBTQ+ communities around the world. In addition to the Pride Collection, Apple said it is proud to financially support organizations that serve LGBTQ+ communities.

The server chips will process ‌Apple Intelligence‌ requests and will be used in Apple servers, serving the same purpose as the high-end Mac chips that Apple uses for servers now now.
The server chips that Apple is working on are part of its ""Baltra"" project, and the chips are expected to be finished by 2027. Apple is working on multiple types of chips, including those with double, quadruple, and eight times the number of CPUs and GPUs as the current M3 Ultra.
Apple is also developing specialized chips that will be used in future smart glasses that will rival the Meta Ray-Bans, as well as chips for AirPods and Apple Watch models equipped with cameras. Those products could launch as soon as 2027.

The worst is yet to come for consumers, according to Pegatron, a Taiwanese company that plays a key role in the supply chain of Apple and other electronics companies like Dell. An executive from the company, speaking to Reuters, warned that Trump’s on-again, off-again, add another 25% for retaliation approach to tariffs will likely lead to shortages as we head toward summer.  “Within two months, shelves in the United States … might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing,” Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung told Reuters. Obviously, the extremely high 145% tariff that the US placed on China plays a major role in the potential shortfall of devicesâthat’s a pretty major tax for companies to pay and likely pass onto consumers. But the bigger issue may simply be the uncertainty around what exactly the Trump administration is going to do next, which makes it difficult for any company to plan more than a few months ahead. “We won’t immediately adjust our long-term plans just because of two or three months of tariff changes. Manufacturing bases require long-term planning,” Tung said. You can see this play out pretty clearly with Apple. When Trump first announced his “reciprocal” tariffs earlier this month, which initially included a 34% tax on imports from China, Apple started scrambling to move its current stock and manufacturing supply chain around in a way that would minimize the pain. The company moved $2 billion worth of iPhones from India to the US before the tariffs hit, and then started the pretty complicated process of shifting manufacturing out of China (as Trump cranked the tariffs all the way up to a cartoonish 145% tax) to India, where tariffs are 10%. Even India could see an additional 26% added by July if no deal is struck. About two weeks into the trade war, Trump announced his administration would exempt devices like smartphones and computers from the current tariff regime, which provided a reprieve to companies like Apple and their suppliers…for exactly one day, before Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said actually that is only temporary and new sector-specific tariffs will go into effect in a month or two. What will that tariff be? Will it ever actually come to fruition? And if it does, how long will it stay? No one knows. You just gotta guess. Obviously, that is not exactly how these companies with massive, international supply chains like to operate. So inevitably, they are going to wait and see before committing to any major shift. That means supply is likely to thin out in the meantime. So if you stop into an Apple Store in June, don’t be surprised if the display models are the only iPhones in the building.",Gizmodo.com

Now, imagine if you have all three: style, power, and an unbeatable price. That is what Amazon is offering with the brand-new MacBook Air M4 2025.
The 2025 MacBook Air M4 is available for purchase today on Amazon for $849 for the base 13-inch model with 256GB storage and 16GB of unified memory. This is $150 less than Apple’s own street price of $999 and the lowest this model has ever been priced. No competitor offers this deal and the official Apple store itself (unsurprisingly) does not offer any discount on this product. Amazon is the only place to take advantage of such a bargain.

New Powerful M4 Chip
The actual highlight of the MacBook Air M4 (released in March of this year) is its new Apple M4 chip which is a gigantic leap from the previous M3 series. The base 13-inch model is equipped with a 10-core CPU featuring 4 performance and 6 efficiency cores, together with an 8-core GPU (the larger 15-inch model uses a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU and it is also on sale). Both start with 16GB of unified memory which will be way sufficient for most users and 256GB of fast SSD storage. For customers who need more space, upgrades to 512GB or more are available. With all the power, the MacBook Air M4 remains fanless.
The MacBook Air M4 includes a stunning 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with a 2560 x 1664 pixel screen, and you’ll enjoy rich colors with one billion colors support, wide P3 color gamut, and True Tone technology for easy visibility in any light condition. The 15-inch model brings it to the next level with a larger 2880 x 1864 resolution screen which is even better if you’re looking for more screen real estate without sacrificing mobility.



Apple has also enhanced the camera configuration with a 12MP Center Stage webcam that supports Desk View so video calls are sharper and more interactive. Audio is handled by a four-speaker setup on the 13-inch and a six-speaker setup with force-cancelling woofers on the 15-inch, both of which support spatial audio for immersive listening.
Battery life is simply astonishing (you can check our review here), up to 15 hours wireless web browsing and up to 18 hours video streaming.
This exclusive Amazon offer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to purchase the new MacBook Air M4 at a price that no other retailer can beat. Although Apple holds firm in charging its top dollar on its official website, Amazon’s forceful discount means that this is the ideal time to switch to Apple’s fastest ultrabook ever.

Because iOS 18.4.1 is no longer being signed, iPhone users who upgraded to iOS 18.5 are no longer able to downgrade to the previous version of iOS.
""Signing"" is a server-side verification check that Apple does when iOS is downloaded onto an ‌iPhone‌. An update can't be downloaded and installed unless it passes the verification check, and the unsigning process prevents customers from installing outdated versions of iOS that are not as secure.
Apple typically stops signing older software about a week after releasing an update, and doing so ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.
iOS 18.5 added new wallpaper, a Screen Time password change for parents, and support for carrier-provided satellite features on ‌iPhone‌ 13 models. It also addressed more than 30 security vulnerabilities.
Apple has also stopped signing iPadOS 17.7.6, because it released iPadOS 17.7.8 earlier today as a replacement for the iPadOS 17.7.7 update that was causing issues for some people.

Fortnite will include options to purchase in-app currency from the web rather than through in-app purchase, which is what got the game banned to begin with. This time, though, Apple has been ordered to allow all developers, including ‌Epic Games‌, to direct customers to purchase options that are available outside of the ‌App Store‌.
‌Epic Games‌' U.S. developer account has been banned since the initial Apple vs. ‌Epic Games‌ battle in 2020, so ‌Epic Games‌ is using the developer account that it established in Sweden to submit Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌. ‌Epic Games‌ created a Swedish ‌App Store‌ account last year in order to create an ‌Epic Games‌ app marketplace in the European Union, as allowed by the Digital Markets Act.
‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney said that the company has ""conversed"" with Apple about the plan, and that Apple is aware that ‌Epic Games‌ is submitting Fortnite using the ‌Epic Games‌ Sweden subsidiary that it established for the EU. Sweeney has not confirmed whether Apple said that's okay, and it's not clear if Apple will approve the ‌App Store‌ submission. In an interview this week, Sweeney said he would be ""very surprised"" if Apple ""decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS.""
When ‌Epic Games‌ first made a new developer account in the EU, Apple shut it down due to Epic's pattern of untrustworthy behavior. ‌Epic Games‌ complained to EU regulators, and regulators in turn started questioning Apple. At that point, Apple decided to reinstate the account after ‌Epic Games‌ pledged to follow the alternative marketplace rules.
During the Apple vs. ‌Epic Games‌ legal battle, Apple was at no point ordered to allow Fortnite to return to the ‌App Store‌, and the case in fact suggested that Apple was well within its rights to terminate Epic's account, and under no obligation to allow Fortnite in the ‌App Store‌ at all.
It's possible Apple will not allow ‌Epic Games‌ to use its European developer account to submit Fortnite given that the U.S. account is still banned, but Apple might not want to further anger the judge overseeing the case. Apple has also already approved external purchase links in Spotify, Kindle, Patreon, and other apps.
As of now, Apple is required to allow developers to add links and buttons to their apps directing customers to digital purchase options available outside of the ‌App Store‌, and more importantly, Apple is not allowed to collect a commission on these purchases.
Apple has filed an emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to pause the ""extraordinary"" ruling that it argues requires it to give up ""core aspects of its business operations."" Apple has specifically asked the appeals court to allow it to charge fees for purchases made using external links while the appeals process is playing out, with the company also requesting control over how those links are displayed.
Apple asked the appeals court to issue a ruling by May 28, but until Apple hears back, the ‌App Store‌ link changes that are in place will stand.",MacRumors

""Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the ‌App Store‌ worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,"" Sweeney wrote.
Earlier today, Apple was found to be willfully violating a 2021 anti-steering injunction that was put in place as part of its legal battle with ‌Epic Games‌. In a strongly worded ruling, the judge overseeing the case ordered Apple to immediately change its ‌App Store‌ rules.
Apple must drop all of its anti-steering policies. The company is no longer allowed to prevent developers from letting customers know about options to purchase subscriptions and content outside of the ‌App Store‌. Apple cannot control link placement, the language that developers use to direct customers to make purchases outside of an app, or the style that developers use for communicating non in-app purchase options.
Further, Apple is not able to charge fees or collect commission for any purchases made outside of an app.
The ruling is a significant blow to Apple. After the injunction was put into place in 2021, Apple had a three year reprieve as it appealed, but ultimately the company was required to make changes in 2024. Apple ultimately allowed developers a single link to direct customers outside of the ‌App Store‌, and collected between 12 and 27 percent in fees for purchases made from those links.
‌Epic Games‌ accused Apple of violating the anti-steering injunction after the new rules were put in place, and requested that the court find Apple in contempt. The judge sided with ‌Epic Games‌, and decided that Apple's solution did not go far enough to address its anticompetitive behavior.
Apple will not be able to delay making rule changes to the U.S. ‌App Store‌ based on the wording of the ruling, and ‌Epic Games‌ is proposing that Apple extend those changes worldwide. If Apple does so, ‌Epic Games‌ will drop all litigation.",MacRumors

The company has also announced or otherwise shown off a slew of changes coming to the infotainment operating system, including an updated Spotify app, a light mode, and the introduction of web browsers and video apps.Let’s start with Spotify. Google revealed in a video last week that the Spotify app for Android Auto is getting an overhaul through new media app templates the company is making available to developers. One feature the music service is adding to Android Auto is Spotify Jam, a feature that lets users share control of an audio source from their individual devices.In cars with Android Auto, that means anyone with Spotify will jump in by tapping a new “Jam” icon on the car’s touchscreen, then scanning a QR code to start adding upcoming songs to the playlist. Being a Spotify feature, it’s much more inclusive than Apple Music’s similar SharePlay feature, which requires everyone to have an Apple device to participate. Spotify Jam will be available “in the coming months,” the company says.Also in the video, Google says it’s adding support for Quick Share to cars with Google built-in soon, letting users do things like add stops to in-progress Google Maps routes. The company also says it’s going to add passkey support for its infotainment OS.Through a Google Figma kit Google made for prototyping Android Auto app UI, we also have a new look at a light mode theme the company is working on for Android Auto. Google didn’t actually say it’s rolling out a light mode in its blog post about all the changes coming to Android Auto, but as 9to5Google notes, the UI option has been in the works for years.One thing that Google did mention — and briefly at that — is that browser and video apps are coming to Android Auto. The company says that app category, along with video apps, will be available “soon” for Android Auto and that gaming apps are available already available in beta. Naturally, Google says these features will only work while a car is in park. The browsers feature is already available in beta for cars with Google built-in, while video apps are already available in that version of its infotainment system. The company also announced that support for weather apps is officially out of beta.",The Verge
